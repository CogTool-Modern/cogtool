# üö® IMMEDIATE FIX: CogTool LISP Error

**Error you're seeing:**
```
[stderr] [CogTool LISP] ERROR: No LISP implementation found!
```

## üîß **Quick Fix (2 minutes)**

You have an **older built version** of CogTool that doesn't include the new auto-installing LISP system. Here's the immediate fix:

### **Option 1: Install ECL (Recommended)**

Open Terminal and run:
```bash
# Install Homebrew if you don't have it
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

# Install ECL
brew install ecl
```

**That's it!** CogTool will now work immediately.

### **Option 2: Use Our Quick Fix Script**

Download and run our automated fix:
```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CogTool-Modern/cogtool/feature/modernize-lisp-apple-silicon-support/fix-cogtool-lisp.sh
chmod +x fix-cogtool-lisp.sh
./fix-cogtool-lisp.sh
```

### **Option 3: Alternative LISP Implementations**

If ECL doesn't work, try:
```bash
# CLISP (traditional)
brew install clisp

# SBCL (advanced)
brew install sbcl
```

## üéØ **Why This Happened**

Your CogTool.app was built **before** our portable LISP system was implemented. The old version tries to use hardcoded LISP paths that don't exist on your system.

## üöÄ **Long-Term Solution: Rebuild CogTool**

To get the **full portable LISP system** with auto-installation:

1. **Pull the latest code:**
   ```bash
   git checkout feature/modernize-lisp-apple-silicon-support
   git pull origin feature/modernize-lisp-apple-silicon-support
   ```

2. **Rebuild CogTool:**
   ```bash
   ant clean
   ant package-mac
   ```

3. **The new CogTool.app will include:**
   - ‚úÖ Auto-installing LISP wrappers
   - ‚úÖ Bundled LISP implementations  
   - ‚úÖ Smart platform detection
   - ‚úÖ No manual LISP installation needed for future users

## üîç **What's Different in the New Version**

### **Old Version (what you have now):**
- Looks for hardcoded LISP paths like `/opt/local/lib/clisp-2.49/base/lisp.run`
- Fails with "No LISP implementation found" if paths don't exist
- Requires manual LISP installation

### **New Version (after rebuild):**
- **Linux**: Includes bundled CLISP, ECL, SBCL (no installation needed)
- **Mac**: Auto-installs ECL via Homebrew on first run
- **Windows**: Pre-bundled CLISP (already working)
- **Smart Detection**: Automatically finds and uses available LISP implementations
- **Clear Guidance**: Helpful error messages with installation instructions

## üìã **Summary**

**Right now:** Install ECL with `brew install ecl` ‚Üí CogTool works immediately

**For the future:** Rebuild CogTool to get the full portable LISP system

**For other users:** They'll get the auto-installing version and won't need to install LISP manually

## üÜò **Still Having Issues?**

If the quick fix doesn't work:

1. **Check Homebrew installation:**
   ```bash
   brew --version
   ```

2. **Verify LISP installation:**
   ```bash
   ecl --version
   # or
   clisp --version
   # or  
   sbcl --version
   ```

3. **Test LISP directly:**
   ```bash
   ecl --eval '(format t "LISP is working!~%")' --eval '(quit)'
   ```

4. **Check CogTool's LISP detection:**
   Look at the CogTool console output when it tries to run LISP scripts.

The immediate fix should resolve your issue in under 2 minutes! üéâ
