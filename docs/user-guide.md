Addendum for CogTool Version 1.2 
================================

> CogTool 1.2 is essentially the same as CogTool 1.1 for making
> storyboards and predicting skilled performance time. Therefore, this
> User Guide presents the new features of CogTool 1.2 here and then the
> User Guide for version 1.1 follows in its entirety.

New platforms for CogTool 1.2 
-----------------------------

> CogTool 1.2 now runs in Windows 7, Mac OS 10.6 (Snow Leopard), and Mac
> OS 10.7 (Lion).

Improvements to the GUI in CogTool 1.2 
--------------------------------------

> **Widget Tool Tips**
>
> In response to user requests, we have expanded the tool tips on the
> Widget Toolbar in
>
> Frame Editing windows. The tooltips now contain the prose in
> **Appendix B: Types of Widgets and When to Use Them** (but continue to
> refer to that appendix if you want to see pictures of example
> widgets).

> **Transition Properties Pane now contains source & destination
> information** Formerly only available by rolling over a transition in
> a Design window, the source and destination of a transition are now
> displayed in the transition's property pane as well.

Changed or new functionality in CogTool 1.2 
-------------------------------------------

> **Default starting position of the hands**
>
> Formerly defaulting to starting on the keyboard, our users told us
> that most of their tasks start with the user's hand on the mouse.
> CogTool 1.2 now defaults to starting with the hand on the mouse, if a
> mouse is one of the available devices.
>
> (This will not effect the initial starting position of the hands in
> existing models made with versions prior to 1.2.)
>
> **Numeric results in the Project Window can now be changed in the**
>
> **Preferences dialog**
>
> Prior to v1.2, the Project window always displayed the predictions of
> skilled task execution time in seconds with three decimal places.
> Users of CogTool found this misleading because the predictions are
> known to be within +-10% of what you would find if you could collect
> data of skilled users performing these tasks. To make communicating
> the results more plausible, we have added two adjustments in the
> Preferences dialog box.
>
> ![](/assets/user-guide/media/image8.png)
>
> Setting the number of decimal places to 3 and not checking the
> "Display range" box retains the Project window as it appeared prior to
> version 1.2, as shown below.

![](/assets/user-guide/media/image9.png)

> But you can now change this presentation of results. For example,
> setting the number of decimal places to 1 and checking the "Display
> range" box highlights the fact that GoogleNotebook is faster than the
> other two designs for this task, but Gmail and Wetpaint are not
> sufficiently different to be detected by CogTool models.

![](/assets/user-guide/media/image10.png)

> You can reset all parameters to CogTool's default values (displaying 1
> decimal place, but no range) by clicking the new "Reset to Default
> Values" button.
>
> **Modeling dragging on touch screen devices.**
>
> You can now model dragging on touch screen devices with transitions
> called "Up Tap" and "Down Tap." Just use a Down-Tap self-transition on
> the widget where the drag starts and an Up-Tap transition on a widget
> where the drag ends. (See this explained for dragging with a mouse in
> Section 4.4.6.3 Dragging Over Text to Highlight It.)
>
> **Widgets can now have a remote label**
>
> Most widgets can now have what we call a "remote label" which will
> make using CogTool as a prototyping tool more realistic. For example,
> a group of check boxes often has some text asking a question that the
> user can answer by checking one or more of the checkboxes. This test
> is represented as a remote label of a standard checkbox widget, as
> shown below. The remote label is connected to the widget (or widget
> group) that owns it with a dashed line.

>
> The remote label is itself a widget of Type Text, so you can model
> interacting with it as you would any other text in an interface.
>
> If your interface is complex, it is possible that the remote label
> might be quite far from the widget that owns it, so when a widget is
> selected, you can find its remote label by clicking on the
> [Find] link, which will select the remote label (below).
> Likewise, when a remote label is selected, you can always find its
> owner by clicking on the link below

### **chApter 1: overview**

> **1.1 What is CogTool?**
>
> CogTool is a user interface (UI) prototyping tool that can produce
> quantitative predictions of how users will behave when the prototype
> is ultimately implemented. Thus, CogTool provides you with a rapid and
> inexpensive way to explore a large variety of UI ideas, compare them,
> and narrow down the options to a handful of designs to be empirically
> tested with users. You can rapidly analyze competitor's products as
> part of a competitive analysis and compare new ideas with an existing
> version of the system to ensure that the new design is better than the
> old one.
>
> CogTool's prototyping tool follows the HCI maxim "Make frequent tasks
> easy and infrequent tasks possible". That is, it is fast and easy to
> construct a UI prototype with standard UI widgets like menus, context
> menus, buttons, links, check boxes, radio buttons, pull-down lists,
> etc. It is possible, although slightly more labor-intensive, to mockup
> more unusual interfaces like pie menus or the slide bar on the iPhone.
> CogTool also exports prototypes to HTML, so you can share your designs
> with colleagues or perform quick & dirty user tests.
>
> CogTool's quantitative predictions are based on extensive prior
> research in cognitive psychology. CogTool uses a "cognitive
> architecture" called ACT-R (Anderson and Lebiere, 1998) to simulate
> the cognitive, perceptual and motor behavior of humans interacting
> with the prototype to accomplish tasks the UI designer has defined.
> CogTool reliably predicts the task execution time for skilled users of
> the UI (John, et. al., 2004; Luo & John, B., 2005). Recent research
> has demonstrated the ability to predict the exploration behavior of
> novice users (Teo & John, 2008a,b; Teo, John & Pirolli, 2007) and the
> power consumption profile of mobile devices dependent on the methods
> user choose to accomplish tasks (Luo, 2008; Luo & Siewiorek, 2007);
> these research results will migrate into the released version of
> CogTool as time and funding allow.

1.2 How CogTool Works
---------------------

> There are three steps to producing quantitative predictions of human
> performance with CogTool:

1.  Create any number of prototypes of interface designs you'd like to
    compare.

2.  Demonstrate any number of tasks on the prototyped designs.

3.  Compute human performance predictions and analyze the results.

> As a prototyping tool, CogTool was inspired by James Landay's SYLK and

1.3 Uses of CogTool
-------------------

> As a prototyping tool, CogTool design storyboards can be used to

-   Build and record design ideas in an interactive form

-   Communicate interactive behavior to development teams or management

-   Produce HTML for quick-and-dirty user testing.

> While CogTool predictions are not intended to replace all user testing
> if accurate estimates of skilled performance time is highly valuable
> to your enterprise (e.g., if every second of a users time translates
> into hundreds of thousands of dollars a year of revenue or expense, or
> if a split second difference in performance time can save a life),
> they can be used to

-   Compare design ideas, allowing you to explore widely, but only
    conduct expensive user tests with the few most promising ideas.

-   Compare competitors' products to your own during a competitive
    analysis or for marketing purposes.

-   Provide quantitative benchmarks for internal use during development
    to ensure that a new design is at least as efficient as the previous
    version.

-   Determine requirements during acquisition and test that the
    delivered system will meet those requirements.

-   Analyze an existing system for bottlenecks in user behavior,
    focussing your redesign effort on the aspects of the interface that
    need it most.

2.1 Downloading CogTool
-----------------------

> The latest public release of CogTool is available from the CogTool
> Project's website on the download page
> (http://cogtool.hcii.cs.cmu.edu/use-today/download-cogtool).
>
> CogTool is available for Windows XP/Vista and Mac OS X versions 10.4.8
> and later.

2.2 Installing CogTool
----------------------

### 2.2.1 Installing on Mac OS X

-   When you download the CogTool file from the website, your browser
    will launch archive software, such as Stuffit, to unpack the CogTool
    executable. If it does not, double-click the downloaded CogTool file
    to expand it.

> ![](/assets/user-guide/media/image17.jpg){width="0.2699704724409449in"
> height="0.2699704724409449in"} The CogTool file is expanded in the
> same location as the down loaded file, which in most cases is the
> Desktop.

-   Place the expanded CogTool application file whatever you like.
    Although many people prefer to put it in the **Applications**
    folder, CogTool will run from any location on your hard drive or
    writable external storage media.

### 2.2.2 Installing on Windows XP and Vista

-   You must have the Java Runtime Environment (JRE 1.5 or later)
    installed in order to use CogTool. If you do not know if you have
    JRE installed, you can test it by opening this link in your web
    browser: [[http://www.java.com/en/download/
    help/testvm.xml]](http://www.java.com/en/download/help/testvm.xml).
    This page will automatically test your computer and tell you whether
    JRE is installed or not. If you do not already have JRE installed,
    the latest release and instructions on how to install it are
    available at [[http://www.java.
    com/en/download/]](http://java.com/en/download/).

-   Double-click the CogTool installer to launch the install wizard.

![](/assets/user-guide/media/image22.jpg)

-   Follow the instructions in the wizard to complete the CogTool
    installation. You can install CogTool where ever you wish on you
    hard drive.

-   Once CogTool is installed, it can be launched from the Windows Start
    Menu, or double-clicked where ever its icon appears.

2.3 Launching CogTool
---------------------

> You can launch CogTool by double-clicking the application icon or by
> choosing the application from the listing in the Windows Start Menu.

2.4 Exploring CogTool
---------------------

> Although CogTool is not intended to be a walk-up-and-use system,
> especially if you want to get cognitively plausible quantitative
> predictions of skilled performance time, CogTool's user interface
> provides common facilities to aid exploration.

-   *Menus*. Almost all commands are accessible through the menus at the
    top of the window (Windows) or screen (Mac). Menus are tailored to
    the currently active window, so explore them all. If there are
    keyboard shortcuts for the command, they are listed in the menus.

-   *Context Menus*. The most common commands used in a window or on an
    object are available in a context menu invoked by right-clicking
    (Windows) or CTRLclicking (Mac). They are listed in Appendix G.

-   *Roll-overs*. You can roll over many objects in CogTool to get more
    information about them. For example, roll-over the tools in the
    Widget or Transition to see their names. Roll-over a Transition in
    the Design window to see its type, source and target. Roll-over a
    Widget anywhere to see its display label, name and type.

-   *Double-clicking*. Double-clicking something tends to open it for
    editing. In the Project windows, double-clicking on a Design name
    opens a window to edit that Design; double-clicking a cell opens its
    Script window. In a Design window, double-clicking a Frame opens a
    window for editing that Frame. In a Script window, double-clicking
    the Frame name opens the Frame editor; double-clicking a Think
    operator allows you to edit its label and duration. You get the
    idea - if you want to edit something, try double-clicking it.

> *and most important,*

-   *Undo*. Works. Multi-level. Fear not \-- you can undo anything
    you've done, so explore with impunity.

2.5 CogTool Help
----------------

> We do not currently have on-line help for CogTool;. However, user
> forums are available at http://cogtool.org/ where you can get
> questions answered and see what other people do.
>
> We encourage you to have this pdf document open in Adobe Reader as you
> work in CogTool. Be sure to use the Bookmarks feature of Reader, so
> you can navigate easily around the User Guide. We have enabled
> commenting, so you can mark up the document as you like.

> items that contain "align" and if you roll over one of them, it opens
> the correct menu and points to the command (pointer in dark blue).
>

### **chApter 3: mAnAging A project**

> **3.1 What is a Project?**
>
> A CogTool Project stores all the interface designs, tasks that can be
> performed on the designs, and predictions of user behavior. Projects
> are stored in files called cgt (CoGTool) files when a Project is
> saved.
>
> ![](/assets/user-guide/media/image17.jpg){width="0.2699704724409449in"
> height="0.2699704724409449in"} By default, the Project name is also
> the name of the .cgt file created by CogTool. However, when the save
> box appears, you can
>
> save the file with another name.

3.2 The Project Window
----------------------

> The Project window is laid out in a grid where the columns are Designs
> and the rows are Tasks that can be performed on those Designs (See
> Figure 3-1).
>
> ![](/assets/user-guide/media/image17.jpg){width="0.2699704724409449in"
> height="0.2699704724409449in"} The title bar of a Project window
> starts with the name "Project" and contains the name of the Project.
>
> Each column header, starting with the second column, is the name of an
> interface design you have prototyped in the Project.
>
> The row headers are the names of the different Tasks and Task Groups.
>
> The intersection of each Design and Task will show the results of a
> quantitative prediction you have made using CogTool (See Figure 3-1).

> Figure 3-1: The Project window: This example has two Designs and two
> Task groups. The Dialog Box design allows menus items to be selected
> either by mouse or by speech input so predictions for these two
> methods are shown for both Tasks and they are grouped. The Pop-Up
> design only uses the mouse, so only one prediction is shown for each
> Task Group.

3.3 Creating a New Project
--------------------------

> To create a Project, do one of the following:

-   In the CogTool startup window, click the **Create** button.

> OR

**Mac:** N

-   From the **File** menu, choose **New Project**.

**Win:** CTRL+N

> Because a Project must contain at least one Design, you will be
> prompted to name a new Design for the new Project (see Figure 3-2).
> The name you choose should be descriptive of the interface being
> modeled. Since each Design must have at least one input and one output
> device, you will be prompted to select devices in the **New Design**
> dialog box. See **Section 4.1.3 Creating a New Design** for more
> information on the **New Design** dialog box.
>

height="0.2699704724409449in"} CogTool\_v1.0beta23 assumes every Design
has a display. Thus,

> Display is selected as an output device and it is not possible to
> deselect the display. (If your Design has no display, e.g., is audio
> only, its Frames can remain empty to simulate having no display.)
>
> Hitting the OK button results in a new Project window, with the Design
> you just named and its Design window open ready to edit the Design. At
> this point you can start creating the contents of your Design (editing
> a Design is discussed in a subsequent chapter.) or return to the
> Project window to set up additional Designs.

3.8 Reopening Project Windows and Understanding the Windowing System
--------------------------------------------------------------------

> As you create a design prototype, you will work in the Project window,
> a Design window and many Frame windows. As you make predictions of
> human performance on your designs, you will work in the Project
> window, a Script window, and the Visualization window. Each of these
> windows will be described in their own sections of this User Guide,
> but understanding their relationship may help you navigate the many
> windows you create as you work.
>
> The Project window is considered the top of the hierarchy of windows
> and it owns all the other windows associated with that Project. A
> Design window owns all the Frame windows that depict the states of the
> display in that design. Script windows and Visualization windows are
> owned by their Project.
>

> Designs and four tasks demonstrated in Script windows. Each Design may
> include many Frame win-
>
> dows. The result of computing each script can be shown in a
> Visualization window.
>
> The **Window** menu reflects this relationship, and you can get to any
> open window, or any Project window even if it has been closed, through
> the **Window** menu. The top part of the Windows menu lists the
> windows above the active window in the hierarchy. In this case, a
> Frame window is active, so its Design and Project windows are listed
> in the top part of the Windows menu. The bottom part of the Windows
> menu lists all the open Projects and this expands to all the open
> windows in those Projects. In the Figure, only one project is open,
> but many windows in that Project appear.

### **chApter 4: prototyping An interfAce**

> The prototyping aspect of CogTool was inspired by James Landay's SYLK
> and DENIM systems (Landay and Meyers, 2005; Lin, et. al., 2000). It
> represents the states of a UI as a storyboard of frames; transitions
> between those frames represent the actions a user can take to move
> from one state to another. Each frame can contain widgets (e.g.,
> buttons and menus) that users can act on, as well as ubiquitous input
> devices like a keyboard or microphone, through which a user could also
> change the state of the UI.
>
> A storyboard can be made from screenshots of an existing product for
> benchmarking or competitive analysis, from sketches of ideas you have
> drawn on paper or a whiteboard and then digitized, be created directly
> in CogTool on a blank canvas with its widget creation tools, or even
> imported from a HTML on your computer or the Web. You can use a
> storyboard as documentation of your design ideas in either CogTool
> files (.cgt) or you can export to HTML.
>
> This chapter will present how to build a design so that it not only
> records your design ideas, but can be used to make predictions of
> human performance (discussed in the next chapter).

4.1 Designs
-----------

> 4.1.1 What is a Design?
>
> A Design is a prototype of the system you are proposing to build. It
> represented the system as a series of Frames and the user actions that
> transition between them. Each Frame represents how the interface looks
> to a user. You can represent just the display of a computer monitor in
> a frame and associate input Devices with that display (e.g, a keyboard
> and a mouse, a speaker and microphone), or you can represent an entire
> device in a Frame (e.g., the display and hard buttons of a cell
> phone). Transitions, which represents user actions, cause a Frame to
> change to another Frame. Together, the Devices, Frames, and
> Transitions make up a Design.
>
> You work on Designs in the Project window and each Design's own
> window. You work with a Design's definition in the Project window
> (e.g., creating, renaming, moving, deleting), and with the Design's
> content in each Design's own window.
>
> 4.1.2 What is a Device?
>
> A Device is a representation of the hardware associated with you
> Design. CogTool can represent a fixed set of Devices. Input Devices
> include keyboard, mouse, touchscreen and microphone. Output Devices
> include a display and a speaker. The Devices associated with a Design
> influence the Widgets that can be include in Frames and the
> Transitions that can change one Frame to the next. For example, if
> there is no microphone included in a Design, there can be no
> Transitions based on spoken commands. You choose Devices for a Design
> when you create that Design. If you want to add more Devices later,
> you can. However, you cannot remove Devices from a Design.
>
> See Appendix A for a list of the available Devices, definitions, and
> tips of how to use these devices to prototype a wide range of
> interactive systems.

### 4.1.3 The Design Window

> The Design window shows the Frames and the Transitions between them.
> Design windows have a light yellow background to distinguish them from
> the other CogTool windows. The title bar starts with the word "Design"
> (see Figure 4-1).
>
> ![](/assets/user-guide/media/image36.png)
>
> Figure 4-1: The Design Window: When no Frame is selected (no Frames
> are blue), the properties of the Design appear in the pane on the
> right.
>
> The Design canvas is the main area of the Design window, where Frames
> are added and connected by Transitions. When no Frame of Transition is
> selected, as in the figure above, the properties of the Design appear
> in the properties pane on the right. Its name, input devices, output
> devices, a list of its Frames that can be expanded to show the Frame's
> Widgets and Transitions, and the type of skin that will be applied to
> rendered Widgets. When a Frame or Transition is selected in the Design
> canvas, its properties appear in the properties pane, discussed in the
> Frames and Transitions sections. The toolbar on the left holds tools
> for drawing Transitions, discussed in the Transition section.

### 4.1.4 Creating a New Design 

> Each Project must have at least one Design, which is created when a
> new Project is created. However, because CogTool allows you to compare
> human performance across different designs, you are likely to want
> more than one Design for your Project. To create additional Designs
> for your existing Project:

**Mac:** ⇧D

-   In the Project windows, from the **Create** menu, choose **New
    Design**. **Win:**

CTRL+SHIFT+D The New Design dialog box will appear.

> ![](/assets/user-guide/media/image37.jpg){width="2.6057141294838146in"
> height="2.263888888888889in"}
>
> Figure 4-2: The New Design dialog box. The OK button will not be
> active until at least one input device is checked.
>
> In this dialog box, do the following:

-   Choose a name unique within the Project and descriptive of the
    interface being prototyped. This will help you to identify the
    purpose of the Design when you have multiple Designs in your
    Project.

> ![](/assets/user-guide/media/image38.jpg){width="0.3506342957130359in"
> height="0.3506353893263342in"}Text in CogTool's item names must be
> within the ASCII printable character set. See
> [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII\#ASCII\_
> printable\_characters](http://act-r.psy.cmu.edu/) for the list of
> admissible characters.

-   Check the input and output devices that your Design should include.
    You can check as many devices as you need to represent your Design.
    Typical computer systems will have a keyboard and mouse as input and
    a display as output. A PDA may have a touchscreen. Speech
    recognition systems will have a microphone, etc. You will not be
    able to click **OK** until you have selected at least one input
    device.

> ![](/assets/user-guide/media/image39.png){width="0.3433333333333333in"
> height="0.3466666666666667in"}CogTool assumes every Design has a
> display. Thus, Display is selected as an output device and it is not
> possible to deselect the display. If your device has no display (e.g.,
> is audio only), this can be prototyped by all Frames being empty.
>
> ![](/assets/user-guide/media/image40.png){width="0.25333333333333335in"
> height="0.29333333333333333in"} If you are prototyping a cell phone or
> other hand-held device that is operated with the fingers, use
> "Touchscreen" as the input device, even if the buttons are physical
> buttons not on an actual touchscreen. This will allow the user's
> actions to be represented as tapping, which is sufficiently close to
> pressing a physical button to make human performance predictions.
>
> When Designs are created, the Design columns appear in the Project
> window in the order in which they are created, with new columns
> appearing at the far right. If a Design is selected when a new Design
> is created, the new Design will appear immediately to the right of the
> selected Design column (see Figure 4-3).
>
> ![](/assets/user-guide/media/image41.png)
>
> Figure 4-3: The Dialog Box Design was selected when Design 3 was
> created.
>
> You can also create a design by importing it from HTML, either on your
> computer or from the Web. This is useful if your design process
> already includes interactive prototypes expressed in HTML or if you
> want to analyze existing web sites. This feature is discussed in
> Section 4.6.

### 4.1.5 Selecting a Design

> In the Project window, click on a Design name to select the Design. A
> dot will appear to the left of the Design mane and the column will
> turn blue to indicate selection. You cannot select multiple Designs.

### 4.1.6 Editing a Design 

> To open a Design window so you can edit a Design, do one of the
> following:

> To add a device to a Design:

-   In the Project window, select the Design.

-   From the **Modify** menu, choose **Add Devices\...**. The Add
    Devices dialog box will appear.

> OR

-   Click the Add Devices\... button in the properties pane of the
    Design window. The Add Devices dialog box will appear.

-   Check the devices you want to add and click **OK**.

4.2 Frames
----------

> 4.2.1 What is a Frame?
>
> A Design consists of Frames and the Transitions that link them. A
> Frame represents a single screen of a user interface. A Transition
> represents a user's action that changes one Frame into another. Frames
> may contain background images and Widgets to represent the look and
> interactivity of the interface you are designing.
>
> You work on Frames in both the Design window and each Frame's own
> window. You work with a Frame's definition in the Design window (e.g.,
> creating, renaming, deleting), and with the Frame's content in each
> Frame's own window.

### 4.2.2 The Frame Window

> The main components of the Frame window are a toolbar of Widgets on
> the far left, a Frame canvas that contains the interface
> representation in the center, and a properties pane on the right.
>
> The Widget types listed on the toolbar to the left of the window are
> available depending on (1) the devices associated with the Design and
> (2) whether the Standard or Custom toolbar option is selected (see
> Figure 4-9). For example, if you have associated a touchscreen with a
> Design, then the Graffiti widget appears in the toolbar, but is not in
> the toolbar if your Design only has a mouse and keyboard. If you have
> selected the Standard widgets, entire interactive menu structures are
> constructed for you automatically , so you don't need the widgets for
> custom menu items and submenus and they are grayed out. (See
> subsequent sections for more information on Widgets and the difference
> between Standard and Custom).

>
> Figure 4-9: Two different views of the Frame window with a Design for
> a NYC Guide on a PalmVx. This Frame has a background image (the
> PalmVx) and three standard button widgets have been defined (colored
> orange, a settable color). On the left, no widgets are selected, so
> the Properties pane on the right displays the Frame Properties; its
> name and a list of the widgets and transitions already defined in the
> Frame. On the right, the Museums is selected, is highlighted in a blue
> and the Properties pane displays the Widget's properties instead of
> the Frame's properties. Both views show the Standard radio button
> selected (bottom left), so the toolbar has some grayed out tools
> unnecessary for standard widgets. (See subsequent sections for more
> information on the difference between Standard and Custom widgets.)
>
> The properties pane on the right contains information about the Frame
> itself if no Widgets are selected or the Widget that is selected in
> the Frame canvas. If more than one Widget is selected, the Widget
> properties pane presents "n/a" (not applicable) in its fields.
>
> The Frame properties include its name in an editable field and a list
> of all the Widgets defined in that frame (see Figure 4-9). Click on
> the expansion arrow to show to the left of a Widget name to see the
> Transitions associated with that Widget. Clicking on the Widget name
> will select it, scroll the canvas to bring that Widget into view,
> highlight that Widget in the Frame, and displaying its properties.
>
> The Widget properties include its name, whatever text is displayed as
> its label (if any), and properties specific to each Widget type. (See
> subsequent sections for more information about Widgets and their
> properties.)

### 4.2.3 Setting the Default size of a Frame

> The default size of a frame is a good aspect ratio for prototyping
> systems that run on a desktop or laptop. However, it may be too wide
> for some devices, like clam-shell cellphones which are far taller than
> they are wide when open. You can set the minimum width of new frames
> in the Preferences dialog box (under the CogTool menu on a Mac; under
> File in Windows). Once set, each new Frame will be created at this
> minimum width. This is the minimum width - you can always create wider
> Frames by placing wider background images in them or placing Widgets
> further to the right.

> untested, and unvali-
>
> dated. Explore at your own risk .

### 4.2.4 Creating a New Frame

> When a Design window is opened for the first time, a new Frame is
> automatically created.
>
> To create a new Frame at any time:

**Mac:** ⇧F

~**Win:**~ • In the Design window, from the **Create** menu, choose
**New Frame.**

CTRL+SHIFT+F A new Frame appears in the Design window. It is selected,
has been given a unique name by default, and this name is highlighted
and ready for you to type in a meaningful name.

>
> 4.2.4.1 Creating new Frames from a folder of images
>
> You may have a folder of images of your interface that you want to
> import. This may be created if you sketched your interface screens on
> paper and scanned them in, or sketched it on a whiteboard and took
> digital pictures with a camera, or created wireframes in a drawing
> program, or even took screen shots from an earlier version or
> competitor's product. If so, CogTool provides an easy way to import
> all the pictures as background images in multiple Frames.
>
> You can import the entire folder of images for use in your Frames.
> Each image will become the background of its own Frame. The Frame's
> title will be the same as the corresponding file name, without the
> extension.
>

> height="0.3466666666666667in"} Only JPG, PNG, or GIF are acceptable
> file formats for CogTool.
>
> To import background images:

-   Open the Design window.

> height="0.325in"}If the Design contains only the default Frame, the
> default Frame will be deleted when the images are imported.
>
> The Frames will be imported in alphabetical order, in rows from left
> to right, starting at the top right of the Design canvas. You can set
> the number of Frames in each row in the Preferences menu (under
> CogTool on the Mac; under File in Windows).

> 4.2.4.2 Creating new Frames containing a "template" of Widgets
>
> When you are prototyping a system that has many of the same widgets in
> multiple Frames, e.g., a cellphone with many hard buttons or a airline
> cockpit device like the Control Display Unit where only the screen
> changes from Frame to Frame, CogTool provides an efficient way for you
> to create each new Frame already containing the same widgets.
>
> To create a Frame Template of Widgets

-   In any Frame window, select the Widgets you want to be on every new
    Frame in the Design.

-   From the Modify menu, choose Set Frame Template.

-   Create new Frames, and each of them will be pre-populated with the
    Widgets in the template.

![](/assets/user-guide/media/image56.png){width="2.626061898512686in"
height="3.518413167104112in"}

> Figure 4-12: All the Widgets that represent the hard keys on this
> cellphone have been selected and, from the Modify menu, the designer
> has chosen Set Frame Template. This is indicated in the status message
> at the bottom left of the window, which reads:
>
> "Frame Template created". Each time a new Frame is created in this
> Design, it will already have these buttons in it.
>
> To clear the Frame Template so your new Frames can be created empty,

-   From the Modify menu, choose Clear Frame Template.

### 4.2.5 Selecting Frames

> In the Design window, click on a Frame to select it. It will turn
> bright blue to indicate selection.
>
> To select multiple Frames either

-   Click in the background of the Design and drag a bounding box around
    the Frames you want to select.

> OR

-   Shift-click each Frame separately.

### 4.2.6 Renaming a Frame

+-----------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| **Mac:** R      | To change the name of a Frame, do one of the following: |
|                 |                                                         |
| **Win:** CTRL+R | > • In the Design window, select the Frame.             |
+-----------------+---------------------------------------------------------+

-   From the Edit menu, choose **Rename Frame**.

> OR

-   Double-click the Frame's name. The Frame title bar turns light blue
    when the name can be changed.

4.3 Widgets
-----------

> 4.3.1 What is a Widget?
>
> A Widget is an element on a Frame with which a user may interact, such
> a button, check boxes, a hierarchical menu, etc.. You will populate
> your Frames with Widgets as needed to express your Design.
>
> There is no limit to the number of Widgets that can be included in a
> Frame, but you may not need to put Widgets in for every interactive
> element in the Design. If you are using CogTool to make predictions of
> task execution time for skilled users, the underlying human
> performance model only needs the widgets that are actually used in the
> tasks you are investigating. If you are using CogTool to create HTML
> to share with a development team, they may also need only a fraction
> of the widgets that might appear on every Frame. Depending on your
> needs, your Designs may have few Frames, sparsely populated with
> Widgets, even to depict complex interfaces.
>
> For example, the Frame shown below (see Figure 4-13), represents the
> first screen of a NYC Guide for a PalmVx. One task that the UI
> designer wants to investigate both with CogTool's human performance
> models and with user testing is to find the open hours of the
> Metropolitan Museum of Art. Only three buttons on the first screen are
> on a reasonable path to this goal, Maps, All Places, and Museums, so
> the UI designer need only place Widgets for those three buttons and
> leave all the rest unspecified until other tasks become important in
> the investigation.

> Figure 4-13: This Frame canvas shows a background image of the PalmVx
> running the
>
> ChoiceWay New York City Guide . Three standard button widgets have
> been defined (in orange, a settable color). The Frame Properties pane
> lists those three buttons.
>
> Widgets will be the source of Transitions in the Design window.
> Depending on its type, a Widget can support different Transitions that
> represent different user actions on that Widget. Transition link to a
> new Frame or the same Frame to represent the systems' response to a

> Choosing appropriate types of Widgets is very important when
> populating your Frames. The type of Widget determines the types of
> actions that can be represented with Transitions and greatly
> influences results of CogTool's predictive human performance modeling.
> However, choosing appropriate Widgets is in line with the job of a UI
> designer, so what you do in your normal design and prototyping work
> fits right into CogTool's process, too. First decide whether Standard
> widgets are sufficient for your design or whether you must use Custom
> widgets; then decide which specific widget to use.

![](/assets/user-guide/media/image38.jpg)
A Widget cannot be changed to a different type once it is created.

> 4.3.2.1 Standard or Custom Mode?
>
> CogTool provides two distinct modes for creating Widgets, Standard and
> Custom.
>
> Following the HCI maxim "Make frequent tasks easy and infrequent tasks
> possible," Standard mode makes it very easy to create complex
> interactive widgets. For example, if you choose to create a menu in
> Standard mode, the entire hierarchical menu structure can simply be
> typed in on the keyboard and it will open and close appropriately when
> you interact with it. Type it in once and paste the whole structure
> into the top of each Frame. Likewise, if you create a radio button in
> Standard mode, you type in all the names in a system of radio buttons
> and they automatically perform so that only one can be selected at a
> time. Widgets created in Standard mode can be rendered as wire frames,
> with a Macintosh skin or with a Windows XP skin. You can easily build
> up entire interfaces using rendered Widgets on a blank Frame canvas.
> We expect that Standard mode will make life vastly easier when
> prototyping a majority of interfaces.
>
> Custom mode allows you to define non-standard Widgets that look and
> interact in any way you wish, but with more effort and care than
> Standard mode requires. Widgets created in Custom mode cannot be
> connected into systems like in Standard mode, so you have to build
> them separately, and combine them carefully so you get proper behavior
> and, more importantly, valid human performance models. For example, if
> you wanted to build a pie menu, you would have to include background
> images that look as you want the menu to look in all its expansions
> and your Design would have to ensure (through its system of Frames and
> Transitions) that a submenu can never be clicked on until the
> high-level menu that contains it is expanded.
>
> Previous versions of CogTool did not have Standard mode so all complex
> systems of Widgets had to be built up as they are in Custom mode
> today. An analysis of errors made by CogTool users revealed that this
> process was the most error-prone part of using CogTool. Hence, we
> introduce Standard mode to reduce the possibility of user error,
> simplify both the creation and debugging of CogTool prototypes, and
> increase the accuracy of CogTool's predictions. If it fits your design
> needs, we recommend using Standard mode.

A Widget cannot be changed to a different type once it is created.

> 4.3.2.2 Choosing Widget Types
>
> Because choosing Widget types is so important and can't be changed,
> even experienced CogTool users refer to documentation, especially if
> using Custom mode. First decide whether Standard widgets are
> sufficient or whether you must use Custom widgets; then decide which
> specific widget to use. To make the necessary information accessible,
> which have put a table of Widget types, their meanings, and some
> examples about when to use each type in an Appendix. Please see
> **Appendix B: Types of Widgets and When to Use Them** for this
> decision aid. After you have chosen the type of Widget you need in a
> Frame, refer to the sections below to create and manipulate those
> Widgets.
>
> 4.3.2.3 A Road map of the Widgets Section
>
> To reduce redundancy, we have grouped Widgets into subsections of this
> document. The first subsection presents all the information that is
> common to all widgets. The next section is Simple Widgets, where we
> discuss Links, Graffiti and Non-Interactive Widgets and the actions
> that are common to all Widgets (e.g., cut/copy/paste). The next
> section is Moded Widgets, where we discuss Buttons and Check Boxes.
> Finally, we present each of the more complex Widgets in their own
> sections in increasing complexity: Radio Buttons, Pull-down Lists,
> Menus and Context Menus, and Text Boxes and Text.

### 4.3.3 Common Actions on Widgets

> 4.3.3.1 Creating a New Widget
>
> After you have decided which Widget to use and whether your interface
> will require standard or custom mode, you can create your Widget.
>
> To create a Widget

-   Select the Standard or Custom radio button at the bottom of the
    Frame window.

-   From the toolbar, choose the type of Widget you want to create •
    Drag a rectangle across an area of the open Frame.

**Mac:** ⇧I OR

**Win:** CTRL+SHIFT+I • From the **Create** menu, choose **New Widget**.

> cut keys, a square Widget will be placed in the upper left corner of
> ![](/assets/user-guide/media/image17.jpg){width="0.2699704724409449in"
> height="0.2699704724409449in"} When you use the New Widget command
> from the menu or short-
>
> the Frame. You can move and resize the Widget as appropriate for your
> interface.

> height="0.29333333333333333in"} It is much more efficient to select a
> Widget tool and then draw it on the canvas where you want it instead
> of using the **New Widget** command. (We included the New Widget
> command only for discoverability and compatibility with other similar
> systems; nobody we know uses it!)

> height="0.2699704724409449in"} When you select the Standard or Custom
> radio button, it stays
>
> to select it once for you entire Design if you do not need to mix
> modes. Standard is selected by default.
>
> The appearance of a new Widget is determined by its type, so please
> see the subsequent sections for the specific appearance and next steps
> for creating different types of Widgets.

> ![](/assets/user-guide/media/image53.png){width="0.25333333333333335in"
> height="0.2966666666666667in"} When you have the same Widget on
> different Frames in a Design, prepare that widget completely in one
> Frame and then copy and paste it into all other Frames that need it.
> This will save you effort and also make CogTool's predictions more
> accurate because CogTool will know that it is exactly the same Widget
> with the same name, size and position on each Frame.
>
> ![](/assets/user-guide/media/image17.jpg){width="0.2699704724409449in"
> height="0.2699704724409449in"} Widgets can only be rectangles. This is
> an approximation that is sufficient for making predictions of human
> performance..
>
> 4.3.3.2 Naming a Widget and Entering its Display Label
>
> Every Widget has a Name and an optional Display Label. The Name must
> be unique to a Frame and is used internally by CogTool. The Display
> Label is the label that a user would see on the display of the system
> you are prototyping. There is *always* a Name; there is only a Display
> Label if you want to have one.
>
> You would want to use Display Labels if you are working from a blank
> canvas because the Display Label is shown on the canvas, but Names are
> not. For the same reason, you would not want to use Display Labels if
> you are using a Frame background image that has pictures of widgets on
> it that already have labels because the Display Labels will be
> superimposed on the background. CogTool predictions of skilled
> performance time do not need a Display Label to run correctly, so you
> may elect to ignore them if you have a background image that already
> contains labels.
>
> When you create a Widget, an editable text box comes up on the Widget
> ready to receive the Display Label and a default name is inserted into
> the **Widget Name** field, located in the Widget Properties to the
> right of the Frame. You many use alphanumeric characters, spaces,
> dashes, and underscores to name your Widget or in its Display Label

**To Rename a Widget:**

**Mac:** R

**Win:** CTRL+R

You can always change a Name or Display Label by selecting the widget
and changing the text in Widget Name or Display Label fields in the
Properties pane. (see Figure 4-14) You can also change the Display Label
by double-clicking on the Widget, which brings up an editable text box.

> height="0.2966666666666667in"} When not using Display Labels, we
> suggest that you change the Name default to a more meaningful name so
> that when it appears in elsewhere in the system or in exported files,
> you can associate it with something more meaningful than "Widget 1."

appearance of the font in the

> of the performance time of skilled users no matter what the font looks
> like (just as skilled human users would have learned the procedures no

> or Display Label is exactly one of these words (not case sensitive),
> CogTool will make different human performance predictions than if it
> is something slightly different (e.g., "OKbutton" instead of "OK"). Be
> sure to use one of these exact words as the button's Name or Display
> Label if it does indeed function as the terminator of a task.

> 4.3.3.3 Selecting Widgets
>
> In the Frame window, click on a Widget to select it. It will turn a
> different color to indicate selection and a gray bounding box will
> appear surrounding the Widget.
>
> To select multiple Widgets either

-   Shift-click in the background of the Frame and drag a bounding box
    around the Widgets you want to select.

> OR

-   Shift-click each Widget separately.

> You can Select-All Widgets from the **Edit** menu by choosing **Select
> All Widgets**, or A (Mac) or CTRL+A (Windows).
>
> 4.3.3.4 Setting a Widget's Appearance
>
> 4.3.3.4.1 Setting a Widget Layer Color
>
> The Widget layer color is the transparent color that fills each Widget
> so you can see it as you work with it; its complement in the color
> wheel is the highlight color indicating selection. The default color
> is orange because that is unlikely to blend in with most background
> images. If you prefer another color, or if orange or its complement
> make working with your background image difficult, you can change it.
> The color is set per Frame.

To change the color of all the Widgets in a Frame: **Mac:** ⇧C

**Win:** • From the **Modify** menu, choose **Set Widget Layer Color**.
CTRL+SHIFT+C A color-picker appears.

> • Choose the color you want from the color-picker. All widgets in that
> frame change to the new color.

> The available Widget skins are as follows:
>
> **Wireframe:** Each Widget is outlined in black. Each Widget retains
> the color of the Widget layer and continues to be transparent so that
> the background image (if any) shows through.
>
> **Mac OS X & Windows XP:** Each Widget has the appearance of the
> corresponding interactive Widget in the specified OS. These skins are

> 4.3.3.11 Creating a "Template" of Widgets
>
> As discussed in the section on Creating Frames, when you are
> prototyping a system that has many of the same widgets in multiple
> Frames, e.g., a cellphone with many hard buttons or a airline cockpit
> device like the Control Display Unit where only the screen changes
> from Frame to Frame, CogTool provides an efficient way for you to
> create a template of widgets that will automatically populate each new
> Frame created in the Design.
>
> To create a Frame Template of Widgets

-   In any Frame window, select the Widgets you want to be on every new
    Frame in the Design.

-   From the Modify menu, choose Set Frame Template.

-   Create new Frames, and each of them will be pre-populated with the
    Widgets in the template.

> at the bottom left of the window, which reads:

> "Frame Template created". Each time a new Frame is created in this

> To clear the Frame Template so your new Frames can be created empty,

-   From the Modify menu, choose Clear Frame Template.

>
> Links, Graffiti®, and Non-interactive Widgets are the simplest type of
> Widgets. Their Standard mode of creation and their Custom mode of
> creation are the same, and the only settable properties are their
> name, their display label, whether they are rendered, and whether they
> have a background image. All the common actions on Widgets work on
> these Widgets as described in the previous section.
>
> The use of the Display Label is the only factor that requires some
> thought when using these Widgets

-   Link Widgets usually use the Display Label as the text of the link.
    When a background image is used, you may not want to use a Display
    Label so the image of the link on the background image shows
    through.

-   Graffiti® widgets usually doesn't use a Display Label because any
    text typed into the Display Label field will show up in the
    Graffiti® Widget and the Graffiti® area on a UI is usually blank.

-   a Non-interactive Widget represents a place on the display that
    users deliberately look at to see and comprehend information in the
    course of doing their work, but they do not click on or otherwise
    interact with that information. Non-interactive Widgets often use
    their Display Labels to present that information, or they are placed
    on top of a background image with no Display Label, or they have a
    Widget image and again no Display Label.

    height="0.21in"} from the Widget toolbar.

-   Drag a rectangle across an area of the open Frame. Try to size this
    first menu header Widget to fit the longest label in the set.

-   Type you fist menu header into the white box that appears in the
    retangle.

> height="0.9733333333333334in"}

-   Hit Enter, This creates the File Menu Header and puts your cursor
    into the white box of the first menu item. Type the first menu item.

> height="1.1566666666666667in"}

-   Each time you hit Enter, CogTool creates a new menu item (the one
    you just typed in) and a spot to enter the next menu item. So just
    keep typing to enter in as many menu items as your system requires.

-   To make a submenu with items that expand out to the side, select any
    menu item and click in the white box to its right, or use the arrow
    keys to navigate to the menu item and out into the white box on the
    right.

> height="1.5533333333333332in"}

-   As before, start typing in the top white box and every time you hit
    Enter, CogTool creates a submenu item and new spot for another one.
    When a submenu is created, CogTool automatically puts an arrow
    pointing to the right, to indicate that a submenu is available at
    this menu item.

> height="1.9515102799650044in"}

-   At any time, you can navigate around this menu system either by
    clicking on the menu item you want or navigating to it with the
    arrow keys.. You can then add more items as necessary. It you
    navigate off of a submenu, it will contract (as below), but its
    arrow pointing to the right indicates that its submenu will reappear
    if you select that item again.

> height="1.9646445756780402in"}

-   Navigate up to the menu header (File) and examine the menu
    properties. There is a unique Widget Name automatically assigned by
    CogTool (in this case, "Widget 2"). You can change it if you wish,
    but it is not necessary for the proper operation of CogTool. The
    Display Label is the words you typed in (in this case, "File"). The
    center of the properties pane is the same as for any other Widget.
    Below Capture Background, there are a few items specific to Menu
    Headers. If you have submenus under this header, you can set whether
    they will open by a click of by hovering on them. Hover is chosen by
    default and if leave it, then you can set the time that the system
    waits before opening the submenu to 0.0 seconds (typical for a Mac)
    or 0.5 seconds (typical for a PC).

-   To add more menu headers, navigate back to the top row, and a spot
    for a new header appears to the right. Type the menu header name
    into it and hit Enter, then continue making its menu items as
    before.

-   When you hit Enter, the \-\-- will be turned into a special menu
    item called a Separator, which is indicated by the checkbox under
    the Display Label in Widget properties pane. A Separator cannot be
    selected when demonstrating Tasks on a menu system. You can always
    change a Separator back to a regular menu item by un-checking the
    checkbox.

-   Check the properties pane to make sure the values are as you wish.
    If there are submenus the action and delay are set as with the menus
    that are always visible. The action that brings up the context menu
    is set at the very bottom (right click (PC) or CTRL-click (Mac)).

-   Type the labels in for the context menu items, hitting Enter between
    each one. Do not worry if the menu item labels do not fit in the
    displayed box at the moment, you can change the size of all of them
    at once after typing them all in. Add submenus as needed to
    prototype your design.

-   To select a single item in a menu system, click on it. It will
    highlight by turning a different color from the Widget layer color
    (in this section, the Widget layer color is green and purple
    indicates selection). The Widget's properties are displayed in the

-   Create a Text Box Widget as shown in the previous section.

-   Select the text tool

    height="0.20048337707786526in"} from the Widget toolbar.

-   Drag a rectangle the size of the text you are going to edit. This is
    typically smaller than the Text Box Widget it will be inside. The
    type in the text you want to edit into the Display Label.

> ![](/assets/user-guide/media/image128.png){width="4.23in"
> height="1.5466666666666666in"}

-   Move the Text Widget into the Text Box Widget. You are now ready to
    prototype several ways of changing "Harvey Q. Bovik" to "Harry Q.
    Bovik".

-   Create a tiny Text Widget outside the Text Box Widget. Give it a
    meaningful name (e.g., "Between\_e\_y")

-   Move it to between the "e" and the "y". (The picture below is zoomed
    in to

-   Create a Text Widget the size of Harvey outside the Text Box Widget.
    You can either give it a meaningful name (e.g., "Harvey") or let it
    have a Display Label of

> "Harvey". (Either way, "Harvey will appear in the Frame.)

-   Move it to lie on top of "Harvey" in the Text Wdiget.

-   Create a Text Widget the size of that portion of the text box to the
    right of the name that is blank. Draw it outside the Text Box Widget
    and give it a meaningful name (e.g., "Right\_of\_Name").

-   Move it to lie in the blank area in the Text Box Widget. This
    creates a target for starting the drag.

    of the area that it would legal to release the mouse button in you
    interface (usually outside of the text box). Give this a meaningful
    name (e.g., "Left\_Of\_Name") and position in the correct place.

4.4 Transitions
---------------

> 4.4.1 What is a Transition?
>
> A Transition represents the user's action that causes the system to
> move from one Frame to the next. Frames only depict the static
> pictures of how the system presents itself to the user; Transitions
> are necessary to represent the interactivity of the system.
>
> When a user takes action on a Widget using a mouse or touchscreen,
> e.g., click, doubleclick, etc., the Transition is drawn from the
> Widget, indicating that the action actually happens at that Widget.
> When a user types, the Transition is drawn from the keyboard (in rare
> cases, described below, a typing Transition can be drawn from a Widget
> while still representing a user typing on the keyboard). When the user
> speaks to a system with a microphone, the Transition is drawn from the
> microphone.
>
> Transitions are created in the Design window and are represented by
> black arrows between a Widget or input Device (keyboard or microphone)
> and a Frame. A Widget or Device can have as many Transitions as you
> need to represent your Design, but each transition from a Widget must
> be unique (e.g., a left-click on a Button Widget cannot transition to
> two different Frames).
>
> The toolbar on the far left of the Design window contains tools for
> drawing types of Transitions action types:

### 4.4.2 Creating New Transitions

> Transitions can emanate from a Widget that is operated on by a mouse
> or, when a touchscreen Device is included in the Design, by a stylus
> or finger. Transitions can also emanate from the keyboard or
> microphone, when these Devices are present in your Design. All
> Transitions are drawn in the Design window.
>
> 4.4.2.1 Transitions from a Simple Widget.
>
> To create a Transition from a Widget to an existing Frame:

-   Click on the Widget and drag the cursor to an existing Frame that is
    the result of an action on that Widget. Release the mouse button
    when the desired Frame highlights (turns gray). A black arrow will
    connect the Widget to the Frame, the Transition will remain selected
    (indicated by white squares at its ends) and the properties pane
    will contain the properties of the Transition.

> For example, the picture below shows a transition drawn from a small
> Button Widget at the top of the "Start" Frame (the button is obscured
> by the Transition's end) to the next Frame ("Map1").
>
> ![](/assets/user-guide/media/image136.jpg){width="4.224507874015748in"
> height="1.5544728783902013in"}

-   Examine the Transition Properties pane to make sure it is the
    Transition you intended. Here, we are prototyping a Palm Tungsten-5,
    with a touchscreen, so the Type Touch is appropriate for a Button
    Widget. The Action is Tap (it could be double-tap, triple-tap,
    etc.). Other types of Transitions, e.g., using a mouse, have other
    options in their properties pane.

> Transitions can also be drawn to a nonexistent Frame by dragging to an
> area of the
>
> Design canvas that is not occupied by a Frame, as shown below from a
> different Button Widget in the Start Frame. Doing so causes a new
> Frame to be created, which can then be populated with images and
> Widgets.

>
> Transitions can also be drawn to the same Frame by dragging to an area
> of the same Frame outside the Widget that is the source of the
> Transition. The Frame will highlight and the Transition will snap to
> the nearest edge of the Frame when released. This is called a
> "self-Transition".
>
> Self-Transitions are used when you want to minimize the number of
> Frames you have to draw in a Design and the action represented by the
> Transition does not change the look of the system very much, or you
> don't want to draw intermediate Frames. For example, if a user had to
> tap the area on the map in Frame Map1four times before the interface
> showed enough detail to continue the task, you could prototype this
> with four Frames each showing a more zoomed-in map with single-tap
> transitions between them or you could reduce the number of Frames and
> use a triple-tap self-transition and then a single-tap regular
> transition to the next Frame (shown below).

>
> 4.4.2.2 Transitions from an Interactive Widget: Standard Menus,
> Context Menus, and Pull-Down Lists
>
> Transitions can be drawn from interactive widgets that change their
> appearance as you click on them in a Frame. Standard Menu Widgets,
> Context Menu Widgets and PullDown List Widgets open up when you click
> on them and the transitions are from the revealed items, not those
> that are visible without interaction.
>
> To create a Transition from a complex Widget:

-   Click on the interactive widget until the item you want to
    transition from is revealed.

-   Drag from that item to a different exiting Frame, to an empty
    portion of the Design canvas to create a new Frame, or within the
    same Frame to create a self-Transition. The picture below shows an
    interactive menu opened to reveal a submenu and a Transition is
    drawn from the second item of that menu to an empty part of the
    Design canvas.

> ![](/assets/user-guide/media/image142.jpg){width="2.8262160979877518in"
> height="1.499861111111111in"}

-   When you release the mouse button on the destination Frame, the
    interactive Widget closes. There can be many Transitions from the
    component parts of an interactive Widget and they will all appear to
    emanate from the closed Widget.

> Click on the Widget to see the individual Transitions again.

> height="1.4957797462817148in"}

-   As the above picture shows, mouse Transitions have additional
    options in the Transitions Properties pane. You can set which mouse
    button to use (left, middle or right), which action to perform
    (click, double-click, press, release, etc.) and which keys must be
    held down while performing the mouse action.

> 4.4.2.3 Transitions from the Keyboard or Microphone
>
> When users type, they are performing actions on the keyboard, and
> thus, those actions are represented with Transitions from the
> keyboard. Likewise, when users speak to a system through a microphone,
> those actions are represented with Transitions from the microphone.
> The section "Working with Sound" details how to work with both the
> microphone and speaker, so examples here will be from the keyboard.
>
> To create a Transition from the keyboard

-   As with any Transition, click on the source of the user action, in
    this case, the keyboard Device at the bottom of the Frame, and drag
    the cursor to an existing Frame that is the result of typing on the
    keyboard. Release the mouse button when the desired Frame
    highlights. Self-Transitions and Transitions to a nonexistent new
    Frame are also allowed as keyboard Transitions.

-   With a keyboard Transition, a dialog box appears for you to type in
    the characters the user will type to cause the system to change from
    one Frame to the next. Type the characters the user will type at
    this point in the prototype. Modifier or special characters are
    added by clicking their buttons. If you type upper-case letters, a
    shift is assumed, so clicking the Shift button followed by a "c" is
    the same as typing "C" into the Text field.

> ![](/assets/user-guide/media/image144.jpg){width="4.948798118985127in"
> height="2.1484295713035872in"}

-   *If the text the user types is not a command to the system*, that
    is, you are simply typing in text, like a name into a Name field, or
    an address into an Address field, then leave the Is Command checkbox
    in its default unchecked state.

-   *If the text the user types contains special characters or
    modifiers*, use the buttons below the text field to enter the
    characters. CogTool will automatically treat these as commands when
    it creates its cognitive model and you can leave the Is Command
    checkbox in its default unchecked state. (Shift is available in the
    Modifier list for when it is needed in a command-key pattern, like
    Cmd-Shift-n to make a new folder in the MacOS. If you want a capital
    letter or symbol above the numbers on the keyboard, simply that
    character into the text field.)

-   *If the text the user types is a command to the system but does not
    contain the special characters* (e.g., very old line editors like
    "ed" used regular characters as commands. For example, "\$p" was a
    command to print the last line of the file), CogTool has no way of
    knowing this is a command. Therefore, such an "unknowable command"
    must appear on a transition by itself and you must explicitly
    indicate its status by checking the Is Command checkbox.

-   As long as there are no "unknowable commands" as described
    immediately above, feel free to put an entire string of text,
    regular characters, modifiers and specials into the text field.
    CogTool will parse them correctly and create a plausible cognitive
    model automatically.

> (The CogTool team will fix this UI to make more sense soon.)

-   After clicking OK, a black arrow will connect the Widget to the
    Frame, the Transition will remain selected (indicated by white
    squares at its ends) and the properties pane will contain the
    properties of the Transition.

### 4.4.3 Prototyping a System Delay

> Just as each user action can cause a system delay, each Transition
> includes a place to specify how long a delay to insert. At the bottom
> of each Transition properties pane, is a text box labeled "Wait for
> system response" and is measured in seconds (sec). The system will
> wait for that number of second after completing the user action and
> before presenting the next Frame.

> height="0.3506342957130359in"} using digits and a "." to represent the
> decimal point. Numbers can only be entered into CogTool is US format,
> i.e.,
>
> If you enter a number into this text box, you may then label the
> system delay if desired. For example, you may want to label a delay
> "Network lag", "Searching", or "Speech recognition", to help you
> remember what the system is doing during significant delays.
>
> If you are using CogTool to benchmark performance against an existing
> system, you are likely to use system delays so that the time for the
> existing system is accurately recorded. If you are comparing design
> ideas for a new system, you may not want to include system delays, but
> compare those ideas under the best possible conditions (i.e., no
> perceptible delay).

### 4.4.4 Modifying a Transition

> 4.4.4.1 Changing the Properties of a Transition
>
> Transitions have properties that are initially set when the Transition
> is created and are specific to each type of Transition.
>
> These properties can be viewed and changed at any time in the panel to

+-----------------+---------------------------------------------------+
| **Mac:** E      | You can also edit a Transition by selecting it,   |
|                 | then, from the **Edit** menu, choose **Edit       |
| **Win:** CTRL+E | Transition**. A dialog box appears with the same  |
|                 | options for editing the Transition as are present |

### 4.4.6 Prototyping Some Common User Actions

> Some user actions require more than selecting the correct action type
> from the Transition property pane. Several common instances are
> presented below.
>
> 4.4.6.1 A Series of Clicks/Taps on the Same Button (e.g., Buttons that
> Navigate or Scroll)
>
> Sometimes a user will need to click multiple times on the same button,
> most commonly when they are scrolling or navigating with arrow buttons
> (e.g., changing the month in a date-picker). In this case, the same
> type of user action on the same button does different things, i.e.,
> the first few clicks make progress but the last click attains the
> desired state.
>
> You could choose to make the result of each click a separate Frame
> with the progress depicted and then each Frame has its own button with
> one click to take it to the next Frame. However, this does not convey
> any additional information about how the interface works, e.g.,
> everyone knows that each click on thee Next-Month arrow of a
> date-picker will advance the calendar one month, and it does take time
> to create these Frames and increases the size of the CogTool file. So
> you may decide to use self-Transitions to represent the first few
> clicks with only the last click Transition going to the Frame with the
> desired result. However, each Widget in a Frame can only have unique
> Transitions emanating from it, so each button Widget can only have 1
> single-click, 1 double-click and 1 triple-click Transition. Use a
> combination of these Transitions to simulate everything from one to
> six clicks on the same button before transitioning to a new Frame. For
> example, a self-Transition triple-click plus a regular Transition
> singleclick represents four clicks on the same button. If your design
> requires more than six clicks on the same button, you will need to put
> in one or more intermediate Frames to prototype the interaction.
>
> 4.4.6.2 Drag-and-drop
>
> Drag-and-drop is represented in CogTool as a "press" on the mouse
> button at the start of the drag and a "release" of the mouse button at
> the end of the drag. Thus, you must have a Widget at the start with a
> press Transition and a Widget at the end with a release Transition.
> The following pictures show the representation of dragging a file to
> the trash and dragging the elevator in a scroll bar half-way down the
> bar.
>
> To simulate drag-and-drop a file to the trash, put two button Widgets
> in a Frame, one for the file and one for the trash. Make a second
> Frame with just the trash Widget. Draw a self-Transition from the file
> Widget with action type "press" This represents a user pressing the
> mouse button down on the file icon (top picture). Draw a Transition
> from the trash Widget with action type "release" to the second Frame.
> This represent that when the user releases the mouse button on the
> trash icon, the file is now in the trash and it is no longer visible
> on the screen (bottom picture).

> 4.4.6.3 Dragging Over Text to Highlight it

> In the section on Working with Text Boxes and Text, we showed how to
> place text Widgets in preparation for demonstrating how to simulate
> editing text. Here we show how to draw Transitions in the example that
> drags over the incorrect text in order to highlight it.
>
> The Frame that contains the incorrect text has two text Widgets, one
> to the right of the incorrect name and one to the left of the
> incorrect name. To simulate dragging across the text from right to
> left, draw a self-Transition from the Widget to the right of the
> incorrect name with the "press" action. Draw another self-Transition
> from the Widget to the left of the incorrect name with the "release"
> action. One additional Transition is needed to complete this Design: a
> keyboard Transition that contains the letters of the correct name
> (Harry Q. Bovik) to a new Frame representing the corrected text.
>
> The figure below shows the prototype of this interaction, two Frames
> in the Design Window and the properties of the first Frame

4.5 Working with Sound
----------------------

> There will be times when you will want to have sound capabilities with

### 4.5.1 Microphone

> The microphone represents voice input from a user. You must have a
> microphone Device included in your Design. When you draw a Transition
> from the microphone box at the bottom of the Frame, a dialog box
> appears and asks for the words the user will speak. You can also enter
> these words by selecting the Transition and entering them in to the

> example, enter "one two three" instead of "1 2 3."
>
> The "Is Command" property functions the same way for microphone
> Transitions as it does for keyboard Transitions; it distinguishes
> whether spoken words should be recognized as a command, (e.g. when you
> tell your cell phone to "Call Mom") which triggers an active behavior
> in the modeled system, or as simple voice input (e.g. when the pilot
> acknowledges the Air Traffic controller's instructions.)

### 4.5.2 Speaker

> Just as the microphone represents voice spoken by a user, the speaker

> Transition is followed to this Frame, in this box. As an example, when

4.6 Working with HTML
---------------------

### 4.6.1 Import a Design from HTML

> If your design already exists as HTML files, either on the web or
> locally on your computer, you can import those files making them into
> CogTool Frames, Widgets and Transitions. The import function is
> limited, but it can be a good beginning that save a lot of effort.
>
> You might want to do this if

-   Other designers in your organization use HTML for mocking up design
    ideas and you want to make predictions of skilled performance time
    on these ideas.

-   You want to compare your design to a competitors design that exists
    as a website.

> To import a Design from HTML

-   In the Project window, from the File menu, choose Import Design from
    HTML\...

-   Use the pull-down list to select a Design into which to import the
    pages, or create a new Design (default).

-   Enter a URL to crawl, either on the web (starting with the default
    http://) or from your machine (replace the http:// with the path to
    the starting file on your machine). If you want more than one
    starting URL, you can add them by clicking the "+" button at the
    right of the field.

-   Limit the import by setting the Maximum Depth to Crawl or
    restricting the domain, under the URL field. The small "?" buttons
    bring up detailed information about how to use these restriction
    mechanisms.

> fields in the dialog box to get the restriction paths to show their

> height="0.3108519247594051in"}After entering the URL, you have to
> click on the one of the other options.

-   Uncheck the Capture an image for each page checkbox, if you want to
    decrease the size of the resulting CogTool file or speed up the
    import. It is checked by default because the images give you a
    better idea of what has and what has not been imported (and you can
    always remove the background images later if you need to have a
    smaller file).

-   If desired, set the maximum number of pages to import lower than the
    default 500. This may be important if you have not restricted the
    import in any other way (i.e., by maximum depth to crawl or domain).

-   If desired, set the width and height of the browser window you
    expect your users to see (e.g., if you are prototyping a system that
    would be viewed on a cellphone browser, it would be much smaller
    than CogTool's default size).

-   Hit OK.

> If you chose to create a new Design, the standard New Design dialog
> box will appear asking which Devices the New Design should include
> before beginning the import. If you chose to import into an existing
> Design, the import begins immediately and shows you a progress bar

### 4.6.2 Export a Design to HTML

> Export Design to HTML converts your Design into HTML pages, which can
> be viewed from any web browser. This allows you to share your Design
> with individuals who do not use CogTool or to run simple user tests
> where the Tasks from your Design can be explored through think-aloud
> usability studies.
>
> To export your Design to HTML:
>
> From the Project window:

-   Select the Design to export.

-   From the **File** menu, choose **Export Design to HTML**.

> OR

> From the Design window:

-   From the **File** menu, choose **Export**.

-   Choose **Export Design to HTML**.

#### chApter 5: QUAntitAtive AnAlysis

> As discussed in the Overview, CogTool can make predictions of human
> performance given the Design and some additional information about
> Tasks. While CogTool's predictions of skilled execution time are to
> within 20% of actual user data, and are thus not intended to replace
> all user testing especially if more accurate time estimates are of
> high value to your organization, they can be used to

-   Compare design ideas, allowing you to explore widely, but only
    conduct expensive user tests with the few most promising ideas.

-   Compare competitors' products to your own during a competitive
    analysis or for marketing purposes.

-   Provide quantitative benchmarks for internal use during development
    to ensure that a new design is at least as efficient as the previous
    version.

-   Determine requirements during acquisition and test that the
    delivered system will meet those requirements.

-   Analyze an existing system for bottlenecks in user behavior,
    focussing your redesign effort on the aspects of the interface that
    need it most.

> In order to perform quantitative analysis with CogTool, you must
> create Tasks and Demonstrations of those Tasks on your Design. Model
> visualization illustrates how CogTool produced predictions about the
> Tasks.

5.1 Tasks and Task Groups
-------------------------

> 5.1.1 What are Tasks and Task Groups?
>
> CogTool uses the concept of a Task to represent the purpose of a
> specific sequence of actions, such as making a purchase on an online
> web site or setting a ring tone on your cell phone. The Task is
> basically a name for the sequence of steps that you Demonstrate on the
> Design, which CogTool records in a Script and uses to compute
> predictions.
>
> A Task Group organizes the Tasks into a hierarchy, and can display the
> sum, mean, minimum, or maximum prediction times for the Tasks in that
> Group.
>
> Tasks are created and manipulated in the Project window. The following
> is a Project window with two Designs and two Tasks on those Designs.
> These Tasks have not yet been demonstrated, so the cells at the
> intersections of Task and Design are still blank.

|              | 5.1.3 Creating a New Task Group                      |
|              |                                                      |
|              | Use Task Groups to organize your Tasks in a          |
|              | hierarchy. The Task Group can represent several      |
|              | different methods for accomplishing the same user    |
|              | goal (e.g., using the menu or a keyboard shortcut to |
|              | invoke a command). In this case, you might want to   |
|              | see the mean, maximum or minimum predicted times of  |
|              | the Tasks that make up the Group. Task Groups can    |
|              | also be used to represent a higher-level goal that   |
|              | is accomplished by performing Tasks in the Group     |
|              | (i.e., subTasks). For example, to send email (the    |
|              | Task Group) from Gmail (the Design), you have to log |
|              | in (subTask 1), compose the message (subTask 2), and |
|              | send (subTask 3). In this case, you would want to    |
|              | see the sum of the predictions of the subTasks in    |
|              | the Task Group.                                      |
|              |                                                      |

> existing Tasks or Task Groups, which moves them down one level.
> Promotion or demotion can move a Task or Task Group into or out of a
> Task Group.
>
> To promote or demote Tasks or Task Groups:

-   Select the Task or Task Group.

-   To promote the Task or Task Group, press the **Tab** key (or select
    Promote from the Modify menu).

-   To demote the Task or Task Group, press the **Shift** and **Tab**
    key (or select Demote from the Modify menu).

5.2 Demonstrating How to Do a Task
----------------------------------

> CogTool can make predictions of task execution time for a skilled user
> on a given Design. To do this, it needs a Design with Frames and
> Transitions capable of doing the Task and a Demonstration of how to do
> that Task. From this Demonstration, CogTool applies an algorithm
> transforming the Demonstration into a Script, which is then turned
> into cognitively valid code in a cognitive architecture called ACT-R.
> This code is run in ACT-R and it produces a prediction of performance.
> Thus, demonstrating how to do the Task is the final step in obtaining
> predictions of human performance.
>
> 5.2.1 What are Demonstrations and Scripts?
>
> A Demonstration is exactly what it sounds like, you demonstrate how to
> do each task on a Design. Your Demonstration is recorded in a Script,
> which adds some steps to your Demonstration so that it is cognitively
> plausible for a skilled user of your Design. For example, you may
> demonstrate typing "ok" on the keyboard. If the user's hand started on
> the mouse, then a cognitively plausible Script contains a movement
> from the mouse to the keyboard (called "Home") so the "o" can be typed
> with the right hand. When you demonstrate how to do your Tasks, you do
> not have to remember to put in steps like Home, CogTool does it for
> you. CogTool also adds "Think" operators in places where prior
> research has shown that people tend to pause before performing
> keystrokes or mouse actions; again, it is not necessary for you to
> learn the rules for placing these Think operators because those rules
> have been encoded into the operation of CogTool.

### 5.2.2 The Script Windows

> There are two types of windows invoked when doing a Demonstration, one
> that lets you select the start Frame of the Demonstration and one
> where you demonstrate the task and CogTool shows you the Script it
> generates.
>
> 5.2.2.1 The Select the Start Frame Window
>
> The Select the Start Frame window has two panes. The left pane lists
> the available Frames for that Design in alphabetical order. The right
> pane contains a picture of the Design with thumbnails of the Frames
> laid out spatially (see Figure 5-2).
>
> If the Design's input Devices include the mouse and at least on other
> Device, the bottom of the left pane contains an option to select the
> Mouse Hand and Initial Hand Location.
>
> ![](/assets/user-guide/media/image165.png){width="0.28in"
> height="0.21333333333333335in"} When the Design has a mouse and a
> touch screen as input devices, CogTool does not know how to home
> between those two devices, nor does it know how to set the initial
> location of the hand correctly. Demonstrations will work, but
> predictions will not include the time to home between the mouse and
> the touchscreen Device.

>
> Figure 5-2: The Select the Start Frame window
>
> 5.2.2.2 The Script Edit Window
>
> The Script Edit window appears once a starting Frame has been
> selected. or when a previously-demonstrated Script is opened. This
> window has two panes (see Figure 5-3).
>
> The left pane shows the current Frame with its Widgets ad Devices that
> are available for interaction.
>
> Under the Frame are two buttons used to insert special steps into the
> Script. One inserts a **Look at** Widget step and the other inserts a
> **Think** step (discussed below).
>
> The right pane shows the Script Step List. The steps that you have
> demonstrated are shown in white; steps that are logically linked to
> demonstrated steps are shown in gray (e.g., clicking on a menu item is
> logically preceded by clicking on a menu header); steps that CogTool
> placed automatically are shown in yellow. See the Appendix "Steps
> Placed Automatically by CogTool" if you are curious about how CogTool
> places these steps and why.
>
> Buttons at the bottom of the right pane allow you to Delete Step and
> Compute. If the Design's input devices include the keyboard and mouse
> or touchscreen, you can select the Mouse Hand and Initial Hand
> Location. in this region.
>
> If you click on a step in the right pane, the left pane changes to
> show the Frame in which that step acted. You can walk through the
> whole task easily by clicking on the first step and using the
> down-arrow key to display the Frames as they would appear to the user.

### 5.2.5 Demonstrating Actions for a Script

> 5.2.5.1 Simple Demonstration
>
> You can record steps for the Script by interacting with the Frame in
> the left pane in a way similar to how a user would interact with the
> actual device. Assuming you have added all the Devices, Widgets and
> Transitions needed to demonstrate the Task, you just left-click on the
> appropriate Device or Widget to make the action associated with
> left-click occur. If a left-click Transition is defined on that Device
> or Widget, CogTool follows that Transition to the next Frame. If no
> left-click Transition is defined on that Device or Widget, a context
> menu pops up from which you can select a different previously defined
> Transition, define a new self-Transition, or Look-at the Widget
> (discussed below).
>
> If there is a left-click Transition defined on the Widget, but you do
> not want to follow that Transition at this point in the task (e.g.,
> there is also a right-click Transition defined and that is the one you
> want to follow), right-click (PC) or CTRL-click (Mac) on the Widget
> and the context menu will appear, giving you access to all the
> pre-defined Transitions as well as the option to define a new
> self-Transition or Look-At the Widget (discussed below).

> height="0.29333333333333333in"} If you have difficulty remembering
> which Widgets have Transitions or actions to trigger them, hover the
> mouse over the Widget to display a tool tip. The context menu for the
> Widget will also have information about Transitions
>
> ![](/assets/user-guide/media/image237.png){width="0.28in"
> height="0.21333333333333335in"} When a left-press Transition is
> defined on the Widget, CogTool follows the left-press Transition when
> you left-click on the Widget. CogTool is catching the "press" before
> it sees the "click", while understandable, but not as useful as having
> it see a click as a click. If a Widget has both left-press and
> left-click Transitions defined on it, access the left-click through
> the context menu.
>
> In the case of a touchscreen interface, CogTool automatically
> interprets left-clicks as taps, e.g., like a tourist guide on a iPhone
> with a Museums button (see Figure 5-4).

>
> Figure 5-4: CogTool demonstrating a touchscreen action. You, the
> analyst, clicks on the Museum button, but CogTool knows you have
> prototyped a touchscreen interface and records a tap, not a click.
>
> When you click on Widgets that have parts that are not visible when
> the Frame is entered, e.g., menu, context menu, and pull-down list
> Widgets, they open and you can continue clicking until you get to the
> Widget that emits the next Transition. CogTool puts all the steps that
> are necessary to mimic the complex interaction into the Script (in
> gray), as defined by the Widget when it was created. For example, if
> you defined a menu system that used hover to open submenus with a
> delay of 0.5 sec (typical for a PC), you will demonstrate by clicking
> on the menus and submenus, but the CogTool Script will list the hovers
> and system waits as defined.

> a left-click will automati cally follow the Transition for the topmost
> Widget. Actions on all
>
> occluded Widgets are accessible through the context menu.
>
> 5.2.5.2 Here's Why Using the Right Widgets was Important
>
> CogTool creates cognitively-plausible Scripts by adding steps to your
> Demonstration. Some of these steps are physical, like homing the hands
> between the mouse and the keyboard. But most of them are Think steps,
> placed where they are because prior research has studied where people
> pause when using computers (e.g., Card, Moran, and Newell, 1980; Lane,
> et. al., 1993). CogTool employs a mapping of the original rules for
> placing mental operators that allows it to connect Think steps to
> Widgets under certain circumstances. The rules for placing Think steps
> are too complex to document here, but you can see that using some
> Widgets under some circumstances places Think steps and using other
> Widgets do not. The number of Think steps will impact the prediction
> of skilled execution time, so using the right Widgets when creating
> your Design is important. (See the Appendix "Steps Placed
> Automatically by CogTool" if you are curious about how CogTool places
> Think steps and why.)
>
> 5.2.5.3 Adding Self-Transitions During Demonstration
>
> If you discover that you forgot to create a self Transition in your
> Design, you can add a self-Transition step on any Widget in any Frame
> during Demonstration. Simply use the context menu on the desired
> Widget and select Perform Self Transition. A dialog box will appear
> that lets you add any available Transition for that Widget. This will
> create a new step in the Script, just as if you had put the Transition
> in the Design prior to demonstrating the task. It will not, however,
> actually put the self-Transition into the Design, so if you think you
> will need it again, you should go back to the Design and add it.

>
> 5.2.5.4 Adding Look-At Steps During Demonstration
>
> When computing, CogTool will automatically produce a model of human
> performance that looks at the Widgets it clicks on as it does the
> task. All you have to do to produce such a model is demonstrate how to
> do the task as described in previous sections. However, there are also
> times when users will have to look at Widgets more deliberately, e.g,
> to get information from a Non-Interactive Widget to make a decision
> about which Button Widget to press, or to read a dialog box that comes
> up with new information each time. You can simulate this in CogTool by
> adding a Look-At Widget step as you demonstrate the task.
>
> To add a Look-At Widget step during demonstration

-   Click the Look-At Widget button at the bottom of the Script window.
    It will toggle and look selected.

-   Click on the Widget you want the user to look at, comprehend, and
    deliberate about. The Look-At Widget button will toggle back to
    not-selected and a deliberate Look-At step will be inserted into

>
> To insert a Think step during Demonstration:

-   Click the Think button at the bottom of the Script window. A dialog
    box will appear asking you the duration of the Think (based on your
    data or other literature that pertains to your Design) and whether
    you want to label the Think in some way specific to your Design. For
    example, you may know that it takes 10 seconds to read a dialog box
    that appears in your design. That would be a justifiable reason to
    add a Think step to the Script, as shown.

> In several previous sections (see "Working with Text Boxes & Text" and
> "Dragging Over Text to Highlight it" in the previous Chapter), we have
> discussed editing text to change a name, "Harvey Q. Bovik" to "Harry
> Q. Bovik". We built a Design with the Frames, Widgets and Transitions
> to simulate three methods for accomplishing this task (1) positioning
> the cursor between the "e" and "y" in Harvey, backspacing twice and
> then typing "r", (2) double-clicking on "Harvey" to highlight it and
> then typing "Harry", and (3) dragging across the entire field to
> highlight it and then typing "Harry Q. Bovik". The following

>
> The Design contains all the necessary Frames, Widgets and Transitions
> to demonstrate all three methods. Notice that the Transitions that
> highlight the text are all self-Transitions and that there are
> multiple keyboard Transitions to the next Frame because the different
> methods require the user to type different things on the Keyboard. You

>
> The Transitions are:

-   For the first method: left-click self-Transition on text Widget
    between the "e" and the "y". The keyboard Transition to the next
    Frame contains "backspace backspace r".

-   For the second method: left-double-click self-Transition on Harvey.
    The keyboard Transition to the next Frame contains "Harry".

-   For the third method: left-press self-Transition on Right\_of\_Name
    and leftrelease self-Transition on Left\_of\_Name. The keyboard
    Transition to the next Frame contains "Harry Q. Bovik".

### 5.2.6 Editing Think Script Steps

> You may edit **Think** steps in your Demonstration by double-clicking
> them and then editing the duration and label. You may not directly
> edit any other steps in a Script.

### 5.2.7 Deleting Script Steps

> It is not advisable to delete arbitrary steps in the middle of a
> Script. Although CogTool does not prevent you from deleting an
> arbitrary step, the resulting Script is not guaranteed to produce a
> psychologically valid prediction. It is better to delete steps from
> the end of the Script, as follows.
>
> To delete script steps from the end of the Script:

-   Select the last step you demonstrated.

-   Click **Delete Step** until you have deleted back to the undesired
    step. As you delete each demonstrated step (in white) all generated
    steps associated with it (in yellow or gray) will be deleted as
    well.

-   Restart your Demonstration from the deleted step.

> ![](/assets/user-guide/media/image17.jpg){width="0.2699704724409449in"
> height="0.2699704724409449in"} You will not be able to delete steps
> that are generated by a Speaker device in this window. If you
> double-click on a Speaker step, a dialog box will instruct you to edit
> the Frame containing the Speaker information and give you a button to
> take you to that Frame. You can get to the Frame at any time by
> double-clicking on its title in the left pane of the Script window.

### 5.2.8 Reviewing Your Scripts

> 5.2.8.1 Reviewing the Steps in a Task Script
>
> When you click on the Script step in the Script list, the associated
> Frame appears in the left pane of the Script Edit window. You can
> review how to do the Task by clicking on the first step in the list
> and using the arrow key to walk through the steps, showing all the
> Frames are you arrow-down.
>
> If you need to change something, you can easily get to any Frame
> window by doubleclicking its name in the left pane of the Script
> window.
>
> 5.2.8.2 Reviewing the Steps in a Summed Task Group
>
> If you have a Task Group that represents a higher-level goals that can
> only be completed by completing all the subTasks (i.e., the Task Group
> is set to display the sum of the predicted times of the Tasks). You
> may want to see all the steps in all the Tasks in one window, and
> CogTool provides this ability.
>
> To view all the Steps for such a Task Group:
>
> • Double-click the cell which contains the summed value for the group.
>
> You cannot edit the Scripts in this window, only review them. Open the
> individual Task's Scripts to edit them.

5.3 Computing a Prediction
--------------------------

> Once you have finished creating and editing a Script, click the
> Compute button at the bottom of the right pane to compute a
> prediction. The result will appear as a value at the top of the right
> pane in the Script window (to the right of the "Prediction" label) and
> also in the Script cell for the Task in the Project window.
>
> The number that appears in these locations is the calculated
> prediction for the execution time of a skilled user. If you do not
> have numbers in cell in the Project window, you might have one of the
> following:

-   Nothing ( ): the cell has not been demonstrated and lacks a Script.

-   Double dash (**\--**): the Script has been demonstrated but not yet
    computed.

-   Question marks (**??**): there is an invalid step, such as clicking
    on a Menu Item

> Widget before clicking on a Menu Widget when using Custom Widgets. The
> Script steps affected will be colored red and will be marked by an X
> on the lefthand side of the "Script Step List." The Script will need
> to be edited before it can be recomputed (see Figure 5-5). This
> situation almost never occurs when you use Standard Widgets in your
> Design, but it is a common error when you use Custom Widgets.
>
> ![](/assets/user-guide/media/image247.png){width="4.694431321084864in"
> height="1.474899387576553in"}
>
> Figure 5-5: Question marks in the Script cell and red lines in the
> "Script Step List"

-   Double-X (X**X**): a problem exists with a Transition that causes
    the prediction time for the Script to be greater than 600 seconds
    (10 minutes). We have set 600 seconds as a maximum time in case
    CogTool gets into an infinite loop. This rarely happens on .cgt
    files created in the same version of CogTool in which you are trying
    to compute (it does occasionally happen when running an old .cgt
    file in a new version of CogTool), but if it does, it usually means
    there is something wrong with your Script. If your Script is correct
    but your system includes tasks that will take longer than 600
    seconds, break them up into smaller pieces in and organize them into
    Tasks and Task Groups (or contact us to make a special CogTool for
    you that can run a longer simulation).

### 5.3.1 Recomputing Scripts

> When you make changes to your Script, it will automatically
> regenerate. However, you should always recompute a changed Script to
> ensure an accurate, updated prediction time.
>
> To recompute a Script:
>
> From the Script window:

-   Click the **Compute** button.

> From the Project window:

-   Select the Script cell.

-   From the **Modify** menu, choose **Recompute Script**.

> height="0.2699704724409449in"} You can recompute all Scripts in a
> Project window by selecting all the Scripts. To select all the
> Scripts, from the **Edit** menu, choose

**Mac:** A

> **Select All**.

**Win:** CTRL+A

> ![](/assets/user-guide/media/image38.jpg){width="0.2638888888888889in"
> height="0.325in"}Some changes to a Design can prevent a Script from
> being recomputed properly, e.g., deleting a Frame or Widget that is
> used in the Script. Invalid Scripts must be re-demonstrated. The red
> areas in the Script window indicate from which point the associated
> Script must be re-demonstrated. If the Recompute Script command
> produces an erroneous result, you may need to re-demonstrate the
> Script from the beginning.

5.4 Exporting Scripts and Results to CSV Files
----------------------------------------------

> Some CogTool users have found exporting Scripts and results to CSV
> (comma separated value) files useful and we present how to do that
> here. You can also export designs to HTML, which is discussed at the
> end of the last chapter.

### 5.4.1 Exporting a Script to CSV

> You may want to export your Script to a CSV file to view the steps in
> a more concise and manipulable format than the Script windows, or to
> use them in reports about your analyses. Usually, you will want to
> open the CSV file in a spreadsheet program, such as Microsoft Excel or
> Google Docs.
>
> To export a Script:

-   Select the Script cell from the Project window, or open the Script
    window.

-   From the **File** menu, choose **Export Script to CSV**.

> The default file name for the exported Script follows the standard of
> **Project Name\_ Design Name\_Task Name.csv**.
>
> The CSV file contains information on the version of CogTool, the
> Project and Design names, and all the information from the Script
> window (the Frames, Actions, Widget Names and Types, and Displayed
> Labels) (see Figure 5-6).

>
> To export all results to CSV:

-   Display the Project window.

-   From the **File** menu, choose **Export All Results to CSV**.

> The default file name for the exported script follows the standard of
> **Project Name\_ Date\_Time.csv**.
>
> The CSV file contains information on the version of CogTool, the
> Project Name, the date and time stamp, and all the information from

5.5 Model Visualization
-----------------------

> The underlying computation cognitive engine that makes predictions of
> human performance in CogTool is called ACT-R. It is complex and well
> validated with decades of research. To learn more about it, visit the
> ACT-R website: <http://act-r.psy.cmu.edu/>.
>
> We have built a visualization tool into CogTool so that you can see
> what ACT-R does to produce the predictions. Although this
> visualization is meant for a cognitive psychology researcher to
> validate CogTool's and ACT-R's predictions, it is fun and you may find
> it interesting. Some designers have even found that it helps them
> identify bottlenecks in task execution, understand why one Design is
> faster than another, or inspire new Designs.
>
> To see the visualization:
>
> From the Project window:

-   Select the Script cell of interest.

-   Right-click (Windows) or CRTL-click (MacOS) the cell to bring up the
    context menu.

-   Choose **Show Model Visualization**.

> OR
>
> From any Script window:

-   Click the Show Visualization button (see Figure 5-9).

>
> Figure 5-10: The Model Visualization window
>
> The operators are grouped into four categories:

-   System - (shades of gray)

    -   Frame (darker gray) - represents the Frame that is visible on
        the screen.

    -   Wait (lighter gray) - represents the system response time.

> ![](/assets/user-guide/media/image309.png){width="0.28in"
> height="0.21333442694663168in"} The Frames are not actually visible as
> long as these boxes indicate. When there is a System Wait, one Frame
> disappears and the next one does not show up for the duration of the
> System Wait. This is not shown correctly in the current visualization.

-   Eyes - (shades of purple)

    -   Vision - Enc (light purple) - represents the eyes encoding
        objects on the Frame, i.e., putting them into a representation
        that ACT-R's cognitive processes can work on them

    -   Eye Move -- Exec (darkest purple) - represents the eyes moving
        to objects on the screen

    -   Eye Move -- Prep (mid purple) - represents the eyes preparing to
        move to objects on the screen.

-   Cognition - center row (gray) - represents the thoughts the model
    has when performing the Task. The long boxes in this row are the
    Think steps. Short boxes are other types of cognitive operators that
    initiate motor movements and visual attention shifts.

-   Hands - (red) represent motions of the left hand and right hand, as
    labeled.

    -   Shows the motor movement that would be observable on a video:
        horizontal movements of a finger, stylus, or mouse; clicks of a
        mouse button; or key presses. In this example, The right hand
        moves the mouse and clicks in between the "e" and "y" in Harvey,
        then the right hand moves from the mouse to the keyboard so it
        can type Backspace, Backspace and then the left had types "r".
        (see Figure 5-10).

> ![](/assets/user-guide/media/image310.png){width="0.28in"

**Appendix A: devices**

You must choose at least one input and one output device for your
Design.

Input Devices
-------------

### Keyboard

> A keyboard is a regular QWERTY keyboard that sits on a desk or lap, on
> which a person types with two hands. Use the keyboard device as an
> approximation to any QWERTY keyboard, e.g., full-sized hard-wired or
> wireless, laptop, external keyboard for a hand-held device, etc.
>
> On screen keyboards, such as those that display on a PDA are not
> keyboard devices but touchscreen devices.
>
> CogTool's predictions of human performance assume an average typing
> speed of 41 word per minute for this device.
>
> When a keyboard is include as an input Device, an area labeled
> "Keyboard" appears on the bottom of each Frame so you can define
> Transitions from the keyboard.

height="2.19375in"}

Figure A-1: Example of a Frame shown in its Design widow that has only a
keyboard Device.

### Mouse

> A mouse is a regular computer mouse. That is, a pointing device that
> fits in the hand and is moved on a flat surface to position a cursor
> on the display.
>
> CogTool's predictions of human performance use Fitts's Law to estimate
> mouse movement time and add additional time for the click when the
> mouse reaches its destination. CogTool's mouse has three buttons
> (left, middle, right).
>
> When the mouse is included as an input Device, the Design can include
> widgets that require a pointing device, e.g., buttons, menus, check
> boxes, etc. The Transitions can include mouse transitions, e.g.,
> click, double-click, shift-click, etc.

![](/assets/user-guide/media/image17.jpg){width="0.2699704724409449in"
height="0.2699704724409449in"} There is currently no way to represent
the IBM TrackPoint, a track ball, or a track pad in

CogTool.

### Touchscreen

> A touchscreen is a display that reacts to touch. The touch can be with
> a finger or a stylus, but it doesn't require a click as a mouse does.
> Use the touchscreen Device to approximate any device that uses the
> finger to operate, even if it has hardware buttons instead of a touch
> screen. Thus, touchscreen is the device to select for prototyping PDA,
> cell phone, in-vehicle devices like GPS systems, etc.
>
> CogTool's predictions of human performance use Fitts's Law to estimate
> movement time but since Fits's Law was originally determined using
> tapping with a stylus, there is no additional time added for the tap.
>
> When the touchscreen is included as an input Device, the Design can
> include widgets that require a pointing device, e.g., buttons, menus,
> check boxes, etc. In addition, a Graffiti Widget becomes available.
> The Transitions can include touchscreen transitions, e.g., tap,
> double-tap, Graffiti strokes, etc.

### Microphone

> A microphone inputs sound into the system so it can react to that
> sound. Use a microphone for any system with speech input or any
> environment where you want to simulate users speaking to each other.
> For example, include a microphone if you are prototyping systems in an
> airplane cockpit because the pilot often talks with the Air Traffic
> Controller.
>
> CogTool's predictions of human performance use ACT-R's speaking model.
> That model uses 50 ms per character as an estimate for how long it
> takes the user to say words into the microphone.
>
> When a microphone is included, an area labeled "Microphone" appears on
> the bottom of each Frame so you can define Transitions from the
> microphone.

height="4.028846237970254in"}

Figure A-2: Example of a Frame shown in its Design widow that has a
keyboard, a mouse and a microphone.

Output Devices
--------------

### Display

> A display is any device that presents information visually to the
> user. CogTool assumes that every Design has a display Device, thus,
> the display device is selected by default and cannot be deselected.
>
> The display contains all the widgets you put in the Frames.

### Speaker

> A speaker presents auditory sounds or words to the user. Use a speaker
> whenever the user gets information from the Design through sound, or
> any environment where you want to simulate users speaking to each
> other. For example, include a speaker if you are prototyping systems
> in an airplane cockpit because the pilot will receive both verbal
> communications from Air Traffic Control and auditory signals from the
> cockpit systems (e.g., alarms and alerts) while flying.
>
> CogTool's predictions of human performance use ACT-R's hearing model.
> That model uses 50 ms per character as an estimate for how long it
> takes the user to hear and comprehend words emitted by the speaker.
>
> When a speaker is included as an output Device, a text field appears
> at the top of each Frame in the Design where you can type in the
> sounds or words the speaker will emit when this Frame is entered.

#### c steps plAced AUtomAticAlly By cogtool

As you demonstrate tasks in CogTool, it automatically places steps that
are associated with your demonstrated actions and that create a valid
cognitive model from your demonstration. These steps appear in yellow in
the Script Step window (your demonstrated steps appear in white).

Specifically where a step is placed automatically is a complicated
algorithm based on transforming the rules written by Card, Moran and
Newell (1980, CMN) into rules associated with widgets. We cannot explain
all the reasoning in this appendix because it requires a deep
understanding of CMN's rules, the notion of a "cognitive unit" and other
concepts in the 1980 paper and subsequent book (Card, Moran and Newll,
1983) and we direct you to those sources for additional information. The
ultimate definition of where these steps are placed is the CogTool code
(which you can get under an Open Source license from the CogTool
Project), but below is a summary of how these steps are placed.

A **Home** step is placed when

-   the hands are on the keyboard and the next action is with the mouse,
    because the hand is needed on the device to perform actions with
    that device.

-   the hand is on the mouse and the next action uses that hand to type
    on the keyboard.

> ![](/assets/user-guide/media/image17.jpg){width="0.2699704724409449in"
> height="0.2699704724409449in"} CogTool takes into account whether the
> mouse is used with the right hand or the left (a setting available in
> the Script window) and and whether typing will need to use the hand
> the mouse is on.

A **Think** step is placed when

-   you explicitly insert a Think step into the demonstration with the
    "Think" button.

-   the previous step is not a Think step (because the KLM does not
    allow more than one Think in a row)

    -   you explicitly insert a Look-At step into the demonstration with
        the Look-At button, because CogTool assumes that the reason for
        deliberately looking at a widget is to read and comprehend the
        information in that widget and this comprehension time is
        represented as a Think.. The Think step is inserted after the
        Look-At step.

    -   a step is demonstrated on the keyboard, Graffiti®, or microphone
        that you labeled as a "command" (by checking the "command"
        checkbox in the Transition Properties pane) because the CMN's
        rules inserted mental operators before "commands, not
        arguments". The Think step is inserted before the demonstrated
        step.

    -   a step is demonstrated on the keyboard that is the typing the
        first command key (e.g., control, escape, etc.) in a string of
        command keys, because command keys are usually associated with
        commands to the system, not arguments. But a string of command
        keys are usually what CMN referred to as a "cognitive unit" so
        no Think steps go between them by CMN's rules. The Think step is
        inserted before the demonstrated step.

    -   a custom Menu Itemis the target of a hover or click/tap action,
        because picking a menu item is usually a command, not an
        argument and Lane et. al. (1993) presents data that suggest that
        the only pause occurs before the selection of the menu header.
        The Think step is inserted before the step that targets the
        item's Menu Header.

    -   a standard Menu Itemis the target of a hover or click/tap
        action. Because of Lane et.al.'s data, CogTool places the Think
        step before the step that targets the item's Menu Header.

    -   a step is demonstrated on a context menu item widget, dropped
        down by either a right single click (typical for a system with a
        two-button mouse) or a ctrl-left single click (typical for a Mac
        with one mouse button). Although the target may be either a
        command or an argument, the act of bringing up a context menu
        signals the intention to invoke a command and the selected item
        in the menu is typically a command. The Think step is inserted
        before the mouse movement that selects the item.

    -   a click/tap action is demonstrated on a Text Box that is not
        "identical" to the last step's target, because selecting a Text
        Box is a command to set the focus in that box. Contrast this to
        clicking on a text widget, which selects an argument (the text),
        which does not get a Think step. The Think step is inserted
        before the demonstrated step.

    -   a click/tap action is demonstrated on a Button/Link that is not
        "identical" to the last step's target AND the two widgets in
        question are not both "OK" terminators nor both "CANCEL"
        terminators. Buttons and links are usually commands to the
        system, but if the user has to click twice on the same button or
        link, that is probably a "cognitive unit" so there should be no
        Think step between click on identical buttons/links (e.g.,
        clicking the back button repeatedly in a web browser to get back
        a few pages). The restriction about terminating buttons reflects
        CMN's rules about redundant terminators. The Think step is
        inserted before the demonstrated step.

Think steps are not placed before demonstrations on Checkbox widgets
Radio Button widgets, List Box widgets, Pull-down List items, or Text
widgets because these widgets typically select arguments, not commands.

As said above, this is only a summary of the rules and the CogTool code
may contain subtleties more easily expressed in code than in prose.

#### d speciAl keys And symBols

A **special key** is a key that performs a special function (as opposed
to standard letter and number keys). CogTool uses symbols to represent
these keys, which you encounter anytime you use them in a keyboard
Transition. If you export your CogTool Scripts to CSV and open them in
other applications (e.g. Microsoft Excel), these applications may not be
able to display the symbols and must therefore use substitutes. Listed
below are all fifteen special keys, the symbols used to represent them
in both the Windows and Macintosh versions of CogTool, and the symbols'
corresponding substitutes when they cannot be displayed.

#### e reporting A BUg

Though fully functional, CogTool is still a work in progress and will
sometimes crash. A CogTool crash generates an error window like the one
seen below.

CogTool crashes result from bugs in the program that have not yet been
discovered or fixed. Reporting these bugs alerts us to problems we can
address for future releases of CogTool.

To report a bug:

-   Copy the text in the error window by highlighting the text and
    copying with CTRL+C (Windows) or C (Mac OS).

-   Identify the version of CogTool you have.

> **Mac OS X**: Under the CogTool menu listing, choose About CogTool.
> **Windows:** Under the Help menu listing, choose About CogTool.

5\. Send an email to cogtool\@cs.cmu.edu with the text from the error
message, the version of CogTool you are using, and a description of the
action you performed immediately before the error appeared. If we need
additional information, we will contact you. **Note:** If you have a
.cgt file and are willing to share it, please send the file as an
attachment.

We will do our best to resolve the problem and will contact you with a
fix or workaround as soon as one is available.

ACT-R
-----

> ACT-R is a cognitive theory of how human perception, cognition, and
> motor actions. It ia computational theory that is implemented in Lisp
> and runs inside CogTool to produce it predictions of human
> performance. For more information on ACT-R, go to :
> http://act-r.psy.cmu.edu/about/.

Demonstration
-------------

> A Demonstration follows a series of Transitions from a start Frame to
> the end Frame of a Task. CogTool produce a Script from a Demonstration
> and then computes a predicted execution time for the Script using
> ACT-R.

Design
------

> A Design is a series of Frames that represent the user interface of
> the system being analyzed and the Transitions that move from Frame to
> Frame.

Frame
-----

> A Frame represents a single screen of a user interface. Multiple
> Frames can be linked together with Transitions to form a complete
> Design.

Keystroke-Level Model (KLM)
---------------------------

> Keystroke-level model (KLM) is one of the frameworks used by CogTool
> to make predictions on how long it would take to perform a Task using
> a keyboard and mouse. For more information on the KLM, see Card, Moran
> and Newell, 1983.

Project
-------

> A CogTool Project stores all the interface Designs, Tasks that can be
> performed on the Designs, and predictions of user behavior. A Project
> is stored in a .cgt file.

Script
------

> A Script is a list of steps necessary to accomplish a Task. A Script
> is formed from a Demonstration and has added steps in accordance with
> the Keystroke-Level Model.

**Task**

> A Task represents a specific sequence of actions a user will take to
> accomplish a goal.

Task Group
----------

> A Task Group organizes the Tasks and displays the sum, mean, minimum,
> or maximum skilled execution time predicted for the Tasks in that
> group.

Transition
----------

> A Transition represents the user's action that causes the system to
> move from one Frame to the next. A Transition goes from a Widget to a
> Device to a Frame.

Widgets
-------

> A Widget is an element on a Frame with which a user may interact. A
> Widget could be a button, link, checkbox, radio button, text box,
> text, menu, submenu, menu item, context menu, pull-down list, pulldown
> item, list box item, or Graffiti®. In CogTool, Widgets can also be
> created for non-interactive elements to construct a full
> representation of an interface.
