      CogTool is a general purpose UI prototyping tool with a difference – it automatically evaluates your design with a predictive human performance model (a “cognitive crash dummy”).

To use Cogtool today, simply create a storyboard of your design idea with sketches, images or on a canvas with CogTool’s widgets, demonstrate tasks on that storyboard, then press a button to produce a valid cognitive model predicting how long it will take a skilled user to complete those tasks. CogTool can be used today to baseline your current interface, or compare competitors’ interfaces, and predict how much better your new designs will be.

Looking toward tomorrow, ongoing research is creating and validating new models to predict other metrics of interest to UI designers, for example, the exploration paths of new users (including the errors they are likely to make).

Welcome to this community of UI designers, cognitive modelers, and HCI researchers working together to make predictive human performance modeling a useful tool for design. Please employ, enjoy, and contribute to our cognitive crash dummy, CogTool.
