conventional English definition is intended, the words will have no
special formatting.

## System Requirements
CogTool is a cross-platform application. Unless otherwise noted,
instructions are identical whether CogTool is running on Mac OS X or
Windows-based computers. Screen images of CogTool in this guide are
taken from a Macintosh; only minor visual differences exist between
these images and the PC.

CogTool is compatible with MacOS X 10.4 and above including Intel Macs
(i.e., those shipped after December 2005). It is also compatible with
Microsoft Windows XP. CogTool will function on older versions of
Windows (down to Windows 98) but requires the GDI+ library, which you
can install from Microsoft at [http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/platformsdk/sdkupdate/psdkredist.htm](http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/platformsdk/sdkupdate/psdkredist.htm).

## CogTool Overview 

### What does CogTool do for me? 

**_Predicts execution time of a skilled user._**

CogTool predicts total execution time for a skilled user performing a
particular sequence of actions on a system.

The predictions made by CogTool are based on a psychological theory of
human cognitive and motor capabilities, called the Keystroke-Level
Model (KLM), which has been used and validated repeatedly by academics
and practitioners since 1980 (Card, S. K., Moran, T. P., & Newell, A.
The keystroke-level model for user performance time with interactive
systems. **_Communications of the ACM, 23_** (7), (1980) 396-410). CogTool
automates the application of KLM to specific problems, providing an
alternative to time-consuming and expensive user testing.

CogTool can only predict what KLM can predict, that is, execution time
for a skilled user of a system. It cannot predict learning time,
problem-solving paths, or user satisfaction with a system. It also
cannot predict the path of hurricanes.

*Produces a ‚Äúreusable‚Äù design mock-up that is as useful for user testing with novices as it is for predicting skilled performance time* 

When you use CogTool to predict skilled performance time, you create a
storyboard of a system design that can be exported to HTML and used in
user tests. A discussion of multipurpose prototypes can be found in;
John, B. E. & Salvucci, D. D. (2005) Multi-Purpose Prototypes for
Assessing User Interfaces in Pervasive Computing Systems. *IEEE
Pervasive Computing 4*(4), 27-34.

### How do I make it work? 
This section gives a brief overview of the stages of using CogTool.
Subsequent sections will explain each item in more detail.

#### Install and Launch CogTool

This guide assumes that you have downloaded and installed CogTool
1.0b18 from [http://www.cogtool.org/download.html](http://www.cogtool.org/download.html). If you
have not yet done so, please visit the Download page of the CogTool
website and follow the instructions now. Sections 2.1 and 2.2,
provides more details.

#### Create a PROJECT

In CogTool, a PROJECT is the center of your work and contains the
user interface DESIGN and the TASK for which you would like to
make predictions. Therefore, the first step in working with CogTool is
to create a PROJECT. Section 2.3 has more information on how to
work with PROJECT.

#### Create a DESIGN Storyboard

The interfaces that you want to make predictions about are expressed
in storyboards. Sections 2.5 thru 2.8 describe how to create a
storyboard for the interface DESIGN upon which TASKS will be
performed.

#### Define TASKS

Once the storyboard for your DESIGN has been created, you will
define a set of TASKS whose performance you would like to predict.
Section 3 of this guide will show how to create TASKS and use
TASK GROUPS to organize them.

#### Record a SCRIPT

The steps a user would perform to accomplish a TASK are recorded
in SCRIPTS. Section 3.1 shows how to record a SCRIPT of
specific user actions by demonstrating them on the DESIGN you
created in Sections 2.5 thru 2.8. Once the SCRIPTS are defined,
CogTool will make its predictions.

**_Rinse, Repeat!_**

Creating a DESIGN, a set of TASKS, and SCRIPTS is the
starting point for creating new DESIGNS, exploring different
TASKS, and comparing the predictions. With a basic familiarity
with CogTool, you now have a great new tool for improving your user
interface designs. Section 4 discusses best practices and helpful tips
for getting the most out of CogTool.

### The Example: ChoiceWay‚Ñ¢ Guide to New York City for Palm OS¬Æ 

To help guide you through the process of using CogTool, we will be
working with an example user interface: the ChoiceWay‚Ñ¢ Guide to New
York City for Palm OS¬Æ. This software provides a directory of
attractions in New York City for Palm OS¬Æ-based handheld devices. The
storyboard and tasks are adapted from those used by Luo and John in
their 2005 paper.[^1] This tutorial will show how to predict the
performance time for two simple tasks using that interface: looking up
the stored information for the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

## Creating a DESIGN storyboard 

The first step of working with CogTool is to create a storyboard of a
user interface design. This storyboard will show the individual
screens of the user interface, the interactive elements on those
screens, and the user actions that trigger changes from one screen to
another. In CogTool, a storyboard like this is referred to as a
DESIGN.

In this tutorial, we will be building a DESIGN that is sufficient
to demonstrate one specific

TASK. Here is a zoomed-out view of what our final storyboard will
look like: (Figure 1)

![](/assets/tutorial-1/image002.jpg)

Figure 1. Storyboard for the ChoiceWay‚Ñ¢ Guide to New York City that
illustrates a museum look-up task (the subject of this tutorial).

The TASK will be to lookup information about the Metropolitan
Museum of Art in the ChoiceWay‚Ñ¢ Guide to New York City for Palm OS¬Æ,
using these steps:

1.  Tap the button labeled "Museums" on the first screen of the
ChoiceWay‚Ñ¢ Guide to New York City
2.  Use Graffiti¬Æ to enter the characters "m" and "e" into a live search
field.
3.  Tap the list item labeled "Metropolitan Museum of Art"

2.1 Prepare Tutorial Materials 
------------------------------

Before we begin work, let's gather some materials that we'll need. The
link below leads to a zip format archive containing screen captures of
the interface we'll be mocking up. Download the archive to your
computer and expand the contents. On the Macintosh, some browsers will
automatically expand downloaded archives. Otherwise, simply
double-click the archive to expand it. A folder containing JPG-format
image files should be created at the same location as the saved
archive. On Windows, you may need to use a zip archive utility such as
WinZip to expand the archive. On Windows XP, you may double-click the
archive to expand it. Remember where the archive has been expanded,
because we will need the contents later in this section.

[http://www.cogtool.org/software/tutorial-images.zip]

2.2 Launch CogTool 
------------------

Open the CogTool application that you've previously installed. If you
haven't installed it yet, follow the instructions at
[http://www.cogtool.org/download.html.] If you are working
on a Windows-based PC, CogTool should have a folder in the Start Menu.
If you are working on Mac OS X, CogTool will be wherever you placed it
after extracting it from the download archive.

2.3 Create a PROJECT 
--------------------

A PROJECT contains the user interface DESIGNS, the TASKS
being studied and the SCRIPTS that define the performance being
predicted. A PROJECT is a center of work. All the parts necessary
for CogTool to make performance predictions is kept in a PROJECT
file. The PROJECT name is also the name of the .cgt file that is
created by CogTool. You are asked to name the PROJECT file at the
first Save.

When you launch CogTool, a dialog box appears and gives you the choice
of creating a new

PROJECT or opening an existing one (Figure 2). To follow the
tutorial click the "Create" Button.

![](/assets/tutorial-1/image003.jpg)

Figure 2. The CogTool Start-up box that appears when CogTool is
launched

Since all PROJECTS must have at least one DESIGN a New Design
dialog box will appear asking you to "Please enter the name of an
initial design" and the default name will be highlighted ready for you
to type in a more appropriate name. (Figure 3)

![](/assets/tutorial-1/image004.jpg\)

Figure 3.The New Design box that appears when a new PROJECT is
created.

You may choose any name you wish. For the tutorial, we used "New York
Guide." This dialog box also asks which devices will be used with the
DESIGN. In this case, the

DESIGN is for a Palm¬Æ, so the only device needed to be checked is
the touch screen device. Confirm your choice by pressing "OK" or
hitting the enter key

![](/assets/tutorial-1/image005.jpg\)

Figure 4. "New York Guide" appears as the DESIGN name

The new DESIGN appears as a new column in the PROJECT window
with the name you specified (Figure 5). Since all DESIGNS must
have at least on TASK, a new TASK is also created with a
default name highlighted and ready for a more appropriate name to be
entered.

![](/assets/tutorial-1/image007.png\)

Figure 5. DESIGN name "New York Guide" appears as a column
heading. "Task 1" is highlighted and ready for a new name.

To follow the tutorial call the first task "Lookup the MET" (Figure
6).

![](/assets/tutorial-1/image008.jpg\)

Figure 6. "Lookup the MET" appears as a TASK name.

2.4 Save the PROJECT 
--------------------

Now save the PROJECT by selecting the "Save" command in the "File"
menu. A standard

Save dialog box comes up to ask for a file name and location. Call
this file "Tutorial Project.cgt". You'll notice that the file name
(without the extension) now appears in title bar of all windows
associated with this PROJECT (Figure 7).

When a PROJECT has been changed from a saved state, an asterisk
appears in each window title bar. For example, Figure 6 was before we
saved the project, and it has an asterisk; Figure 7 shows the window
after we saved the project and there is no asterisk.

![](/assets/tutorial-1/image009.jpg\)

Figure 7. The PROJECT has been saved as "TutorialProject". Notice
that no asterisk appears in the window title.

2.5 Open the DESIGN 
-------------------

Now you must open the DESIGN so you can create the DESIGN
storyboard for the New York Guide. You may double-click on the name of
the DESIGN, or you may click on the name once to select it and
then choose the "Edit" command from the "Edit" menu, or select "Edit"
from the DESIGN name's contextual menu. The SCRIPT cell below
the DESIGN name will highlight, and a dot will appear next to the
DESIGN name, to show that the DESIGN is selected (Figure 8).

![](/assets/tutorial-1/image010.png\)

Figure 8. The "New York Guide" DESIGN has been selected, which is
indicated by the dot next to the DESIGN name.

2.6 Add FRAMES 
--------------

When the new DESIGN window opens a new FRAME is automatically
created (Figure 9).

![](/assets/tutorial-1/image011.jpg\)
![](/assets/tutorial-1/image012.jpg\)

Figure 9. The DESIGN window for the "New York Guide" DESIGN has a
single FRAME automatically placed in it

At this point, we could add content to Frame 1 and add new FRAMES
one at a time. However, we know we are going to have five FRAMES
in the "New York Guide" DESIGN and already have images that we
want to place inside the FRAMES. Adding each FRAME one at a
time would be slow, but we can use the "Import Frame Background
Images" command to automatically create a FRAME for each image in
the folder and place the image in the FRAME as the background.
Select the "Modify" menu, then the "Import Frame Background Images"
from the drop down list (Figure 10)

![](/assets/tutorial-1/image013.jpg\)
![](/assets/tutorial-1/image014.jpg\)

![](/assets/tutorial-1/image020.jpg\)

Figure 10. Selecting the "Import Frame Background Images" command
from the Modify menu in the "New York Guide" DESIGN window.

Navigate through the "Select a directory of images" dialog box to the
"tutorial-images" folder you down loaded (See 2.1 Prepare Tutorial
Materials). Select the folder and then hit the "Choose" button (Figure
11).

![](/assets/tutorial-1/image021.png\)

Figure 11. "Select a directory of images" dialog box for importing
background images from a folder into FRAMES.

Your "New York Guide" DESIGN window should appear as in Figure 12.

![](/assets/tutorial-1/image029.jpg\)

Figure 12. The "New York Guide" DESIGN window after the
"tutorial-images" files were imported as background images for new
FRAMES.

KNOWN BUG \#1. When FRAMES are stacked, the stacking order is
mysterious and may even seem to change over time. Work around: move
the FRAMES apart so they are not stacked.

You will need to see each FRAME in its entirety so it'll be
necessary to move the FRAMES apart. Simply press the left mouse
button inside the body of a FRAME, drag the mouse to the new
location, and release the mouse button. Make your DESIGN window
resemble Figure 13.

![](/assets/tutorial-1/image033.jpg)

Figure 13. "New York Guide" DESIGN window after five FRAMES have
been created using the "Import Background Frame Images" command and
have been rearranged so that the entirety of each FRAME could be
seen.

2.7 Define WIDGETS 
------------------

In order to interact with your DESIGN storyboard, you must define
WIDGETS on each FRAME for each interface element that the user
would manipulate in a TASK, e.g. buttons, check boxes, radio
buttons, or menus. In CogTool, a WIDGET is a "hot-spot" that you
create in a FRAME to indicate the area that is interactive on the
actual physical device.

In this tutorial, the first step of our TASK is to tap the
"Museum" button on the FRAME called "1-Start". Therefore, we need
to define a WIDGET for the "Museums" button. (In general, there is
no need to create WIDGETS for every element of the original
interface, only for those needed for the tasks you want to
investigate.) On the screen shot of the PalmPilot the area on the
screen under the words "Museum" is the area our first WIDGET is to
represent. To create the WIDGET, open FRAME "1-Start" by
double clicking on the FRAME in the DESIGN window (Figure 14).

![](/assets/tutorial-1/image041.jpg)

Figure 14. FRAME 1\_Start. The WIDGET toolbar is along the left
side. The FRAME on which to place WIDGETS is in the center (in this
case, it has the first screen of the New York Guide Palm application as its background). The WIDGET property pane is on the right side (it is grayed out in this figure because no
WIDGET is selected).

It is important to select the proper type for a WIDGET so thatCogTool can make accurate predictions. The type is based on its function in the interface. Different values are used for different types of user interface elements, such as the "List Box Item" type for each row of a list box, the "Menu" type for the menu header in a menu bar, the "Menu Item" type for individual menu items, and the "Pull-Down List" and "Pull-Down Item" types for interface elements
that allow you to select a single item from a list of items (sometimes
referred to as a "combo box"). See Table 1 in the CogTool Users Guide
for a list of the WIDGETS supported by CogTool and guidelines for
when to use each WIDGET.

![](/assets/tutorial-1/image042.jpg\)

CogTool User Guide (p. 45) for more detailed descriptions and examples
of each type of WIDGET.

<span style="float:right;" markdown="1">
![](/assets/tutorial-1/image043.png\)
</span>
The widget needed in Frame "1-Start"
needs to function as a button (see examples in Table 1 of the CogTool
User Guide, p 45). The button tool at the top of the toolbar is
selected by default when you open a FRAME. Make sure this tool is
selected (it will be outlined in a darker shade of gray than the other
tools).

<span style="float:right;" markdown="1">
![](/assets/tutorial-1/image045.png\)
</span>
Create a WIDGET over the area of the "Museums"
button on the background image by dragging a rectangle across that
area of the FRAME. Do this by pressing the left mouse button,
moving the mouse over the area you wish to select, and then releasing
the mouse button.

<span style="float:right;" markdown="1">
![](/assets/tutorial-1/image047.jpg\)<br>![](/assets/tutorial-1/image048.jpg\)
</span>
As an alternative, you could also use the "New WIDGET..." commandin the "Create" menu, which will place a WIDGET in the upper left corner of the FRAME. You then move and resize the WIDGET to the appropriate position.

Move a WIDGET by pressing with the left mouse button on the
translucent area of the WIDGET and dragging the mouse to the new location. To more precisely position a WIDGET, use the Nudge commands available in the Modify menu or in the contextual menu
available on the WIDGET. You can also use the arrow keys to nudge
a selected WIDGET into place.

Resize a WIDGET by clicking and dragging the small white square
handles at the corners of a selected WIDGET.

You may zoom in and out on the background image to make placing
WIDGETS easier. These commands are available in the "Modify" menu
or in the contextual menu that pops up for the FRAME background.
(You may open the contextual menu by clicking the background of the
FRAME with the right mouse button. On a Mac, you click with the
left mouse button while holding the CTRL key.) The "Zoom to Fit"
command is particularly useful, making the background image exactly
fit the available space in the window. The keyboard shortcuts for
Zoom-to-Fit are apple-/ for Mac and CTRL-/ for PC. You can also zoom
to preset percentages by selecting the desired percentage in the
"Zoom" field in the bottom portion of the FRAME.

#### 2.7.1 Set WIDGET Properties 

The property pane on the right side of the FRAME window shows the
properties of the selected WIDGET. Each WIDGET must have a
unique name. A WIDGET name can be used by only one WIDGET on a
particular FRAME. For this WIDGET, use the name "Museums". You
may use any text you wish for the name of a WIDGET.

A WIDGET can simply be a hot-spot over a background image, as is
the case with this Museums button, or you can check the Use Rendered
Version checkbox. This puts a thin border around the hotspot, so you
can see the button when there is no background image. (In future
versions of CogTool, there will be rendered images for Mac, PC and
Palm platforms.) When you use a rendered version, the Displayed Label
textbox allows you to enter text that will be displayed on the
WIDGET. Since our frame has a background image with the word
"Museums" already on it, we will leave the checkbox unchecked and the
textbox blank. ( Figure 16). A WIDGET can also have its own image
(set with the Set Widget Image button) or capture the background image
(see the last section of this tutorial), but these features are
unnecessary for this tutorial.

![](/assets/tutorial-1/image052.jpg\)

Figure 16. A **_WIDGET_****_,_** Type: Button, has been placed over the
image of the Museums button on the Palm Pilot and named "Museums".

A FRAME can have many WIDGETS to mock-up as much of the
interactivity of a DESIGN as you would like. In this task, we only
need a single WIDGET on this FRAME, so we are now done with
this FRAME. Close the FRAME window and return to the
DESIGN window. The DESIGN window will reflect the changes you
have made to the "1-Start" FRAME by showing the orange hotspot on
the Museum button (Figure 17).

![](/assets/tutorial-1/image053.png\)

Figure 17. The DESIGN window reflects the changes made to
the"1-Start" FRAME.

#### 2.7.2 Add Content to All FRAMES 

  Repeat the process described above to add the necessary WIDGETS to
  all FRAMES of the storyboard, as follows.
 
  NOTE \#1. When you have two actions in a row that act on the same
  WIDGET, like the two Graffiti strokes in the tutorial task, it is
  important for the two WIDGETS to be absolutely identical. The only
  way be sure that two WIDGETS are absolutely identical is to create
  one and then copy it onto all the other FRAMES that need that
  identical WIDGET. All properties, including the name and type will
  be copied
 
  NOTE \#2. If you accidentally didn't have the correct WIDGET
  type selected before you create your WIDGET, you must delete the
  WIDGET, select the correct WIDGET type with the toolbar button
  on the left, and recreate the WIDGET.

  Figure 19. All FRAMES in the DESIGN are populated with background
  images and
 
  WIDGETS sufficient to do the TASK.

 2.8 Link FRAMES via TRANSITIONS 
-------------------------------

  We have now created all of the FRAMES of the storyboard for this
  DESIGN. However, the
 
  DESIGN is only complete when multiple FRAMES are linked
  together to follow the series of steps in a TASK. The links
  between FRAMES are called TRANSITIONS and each represents a
  user action on the interface that causes a new FRAME to appear.
  For example, when the user taps on the "Museums" WIDGET on the
  "Start" frame, we want the "Museums List" FRAME to appear.

#### 2.8.1 Create a TRANSITION 

  To create a TRANSITION from the "Museums Button" WIDGET to the
  "Museums List" FRAME, press the left mouse button on the
  WIDGET that will cause the TRANSITION to occur, drag the
  cursor to the destination FRAME so that it highlights (Figure 20),
  and then release the mouse button. An arrow will connect the
  WIDGET to an edge of the destination FRAME.
 
  If you have trouble clicking on WIDGETS because they are too
  small, use the "Zoom" commands in the "Modify" menu.
 
  ![](media/image57.jpg){width="3.0in" height="1.61in"}
 
  Figure 20. Creating a transition by dragging from the "Museums
  Button" WIDGET in the "1\_Start" FRAME to the "Museums List" FRAME.
  The destination FRAME highlights by turning gray.

#### 2.8.2 Edit TRANSITION Properties 

  Like WIDGETS, TRANSITIONS have properties that can be
  configured in the panel on the right side of the DESIGN window.
  Each TRANSITION is triggered by a specific user action. For
  example, a design using a touch-screen can TRANSITIONS triggered
  by tap or double-tap on a particular button WIDGET. Each type of
  WIDGET can respond to different types of user actions, and
  therefore different TRANSITIONS have different properties. When a
  new TRANSITION, or an existing one, is selected, the Action field
  will have the available properties.
 
  Figure 21 shows the actions available for touch screen (Tap,
  Double-Tap, and Hover, because some touch-screen can detect fingers
  hovering above their surface). Figure 22 show the single action
  available for Graffiti¬Æ "Graffiti¬Æ Gestures:". A Graffiti¬Æ gesture
  also has a property of being a command (the "Is Command" box must be
  checked) or not (the "Is Command" box must be empty).

  Figure 22. Graffiti¬Æ gestures are either text or commands. Both
  types are entered into the text box. To indicate a command check the
  box on the right.
 
  Now add TRANSITIONS for each step in the TASK as follows:

  [From WIDGET in FRAME ]{.underline}   [To FRAME]{.underline} [Action]{.underline}
  --------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------
  1-Start 2-Museums\_List                       Tap
  2-Museum\_List 3-m\_List                      Graffiti¬Æ gesture "m"
  3-m\_List 4-me\_List                          Graffiti¬Æ gesture "e"
  4-me\_List 5-The\_Met                         Tap

  NOTE \#3. To indicate a command that requires two gestures (e.g.,
  many commands start with a gesture that looks like a /), please use
  "/" before the letter of the command. Therefore the gesture command
  for Cut would be "_x", for Copy would be "_c", for Paste would be
  "/v", etc. In addition, check the Is-Command check-box to tell CogTool
  that these gestures constitute a command.
 
  NOTE \#4. A "self transition" can also be made. You would use a
  self-transition if the user's action did not change the look of the
  interface your are mocking up, or if you want to use one FRAME to
  demonstrate many actions and you don't care that the look of the
  interface doesn't change during this part of the demonstration. To
  make a self-TRANSITION, simply click on the WIDGET that
  triggers the self-TRANSITION and drag a short distance off that
  WIDGET but still on the frame, then release the mouse button. An
  arrow will go from the WIDGET to the edge of FRAME to indicate
  the self-TRANSITION.
 
  When you are finished, your storyboard should look like Figure 23
  below. You can now close the DESIGN window to return to the
  PROJECT window.

  Figure 23. TRANSITIONS complete. The TRANSITION in Frame
  "4-me\_List" is selected.
 
  The entire DESIGN is finished at this point and is sufficient to
  demonstrate the TASK of looking up the MET.

3 Demonstrate a TASK and Produce a Prediction 
=============================================

  CogTool needs three ingredients for each prediction: an interface
  DESIGN, a TASK, and a
 
  SCRIPT of actions. In Section 2 we named the task "Lookup the MET"
  and created the New York Guide DESIGN using FRAMES,
  WIDGETS, and TRANSITIONS. This section shows how to
  demonstrate a TASK to create a SCRIPT of actions.

 3.1 Open a SCRIPT 
-----------------

  A SCRIPT is opened by double-clicking on the cell at the
  intersection of a TASK and a DESIGN. You may also open the
  contextual menu for a script by clicking the right mouse button in the
  cell. (On a Mac, click while holding the CTRL key.) Then, choose the
  "Edit SCRIPT" command from the contextual menu (Figure 24).
 
  ![](media/image64.jpg){width="3.2216666666666667in"
  height="1.6760520559930008in"}
 
  Figure 24. Edit the SCRIPT by using the contextual menu.

 3.2 Choose a Start FRAME 
------------------------

  Since a SCRIPT may begin at any FRAME in the DESIGN, you
  must select the start FRAME separately for each SCRIPT. To
  select the start FRAME, double-click on a FRAME (Figure 25) or
  its name in the list at the left. You may also click the desired
  FRAME to select it, and then press the "Start Demonstrating Task"
  button or the Enter key. In this tutorial, we called the first
  FRAME in this the Look-up-the-Met task the "1-Start" FRAME.
  Double-click on the "1Start" FRAME to begin. The FRAME-chooser
  window will be replaced by the main SCRIPT editor window.
 
  ![](media/image72.jpg){width="3.3366666666666664in" height="2.36in"}
 
  Figure 25. The initial SCRIPT window with the "1-Start" FRAME
  selected.

 3.3 Demonstrate Actions 
-----------------------

  In the SCRIPT editor window, you will interact with the DESIGN
  to record a sequence of SCRIPT STEPS in a SCRIPT. The
  beginning FRAME appears in the left pane, and the current list of
  STEPS in the SCRIPT appears in the right pane. A set of
  buttons for manipulating the SCRIPT is located at the bottom of
  the window.
 
  As with the FRAME and DESIGN windows, you may use the "Zoom"
  commands to make your work easier. The "Zoom" commands can be found in
  the "Modify" menu or in the contextual menu for the FRAME. Use the
  "Zoom to Fit" command now to make your window look like Figure 26
  below.

![](media/image80.jpg){width="4.876666666666667in"
height="4.1866666666666665in"}

  Figure 26. The SCRIPT editor window.
 
  To record new STEPS, interact with the storyboard as a user would
  interact with an actual device. In the case of a touch screen
  interface like a Palm OS¬Æ-based handheld, CogTool automatically
  interprets mouse clicks that you make in your demonstration as taps
  that a user would make on a Palm. The TRANSITIONS associated with
  your actions will be followed automatically. That is, the current
  FRAME will be replaced with the destination FRAME of the
  TRANSITION. For each action you perform, a new STEP will be
  added to the SCRIPT.
 
  Click on the Museums button now to demonstrate the first STEP in
  the TASK. The window changes to look like Figure 27.

![](media/image81.jpg){width="5.123333333333333in"
height="3.8066666666666666in"}

  Figure 27. Result of demonstrating the first STEP in the TASK.
 
  In the SCRIPT STEP list on the right, CogTool has put three
  STEPS in response to the single action demonstrated (clicking on
  the "Museums Button"). They are a "Think" action for 1.2 seconds, a
  "Look At" to find the "Museums Button", and a "Move and Tap" action to
  the "Museums Button". Think and Look-at STEPS are inserted
  automatically because prior research in psychology and human-computer
  interaction has shown that when people tap on a button, they think to
  remember which button to press, they look at the button, and then they
  tap that button. The tap results in the FRAME changing to the
  "Museums List" FRAME, which is now shown on the left and listed as
  the last line of the SCRIPT STEP List. Automatically inserting
  Think and Look-at STEPS is an important part of CogTool's
  functionality. By doing this automatically, CogTool allows analysts to
  produce valid models whether they have studied psychology or not. The
  placement of Think and Look-at STEPS is backed by decades of
  psychology research and HCI data and is at the core of the research
  that produced CogTool.
 
  The STEPS that are inserted automatically are shaded in yellow to
  distinguish them from STEPS deliberately demonstrated by the
  analyst (white STEPS). All of the yellow STEPS above a white
  STEP are associated with that white STEP. If a white STEP
  is deleted, all its yellow STEPS will be deleted as well.
 
  If you have difficulty remembering which TRANSITIONS are
  associated with which WIDGETS, hold the mouse over a WIDGET to
  display a tool-tip. You can also use the WIDGET'S contextual menu
  to select a specific TRANSITION (Figure 28).

![](media/image89.jpg){width="4.22in" height="3.1166666666666667in"}

  Figure 28. Contextual menu on the Graffiti¬Æ WIDGET.
 
  When a TRANSITION is a tap or double-tap, you can demonstrate the
  STEP simply by performing the action on the WIDGET (tap or
  double-tap). If the TRANSITION is some other type, you must open
  the contextual menu on the WIDGET and select the action you want
  to perform to record a STEP. Figure 28 shows the contextual menu
  displaying the choices for the next STEP: entering Graffiti¬Æ
  strokes "m" on the Graffiti¬Æ Letter WIDGET, looking at the
  Graffiti¬Æ Letter WIDGET, or entering new text into the Graffiti¬Æ
  Letter WIDGET. Select "Perform Enter Graffiti¬Æ Strokes m On Letter
  Input" as the next STEP in our TASK which results in the
  screen shown in Figure 29.

![](media/image97.jpg){width="4.456666666666667in"
height="2.753332239720035in"}

  Figure 29. Two STEPS have been demonstrated.

#### 3.3.1 System Delays 

  An accurate prediction of user task time must include time spent
  waiting for the system to complete requested actions. Sometimes
  systems are so fast that system delays are negligible and you don't
  need to include waiting time, but sometimes (as in the case of this
  Palm app), the delays are noticeable. To simulate a system delay,
  press the "Wait for System" button, and then enter the amount of time
  in seconds the user will wait.
 
  You can insert system delay in two ways, while you are demonstrating
  the STEPS or after a STEP has been demonstrated.
 
  In the task we are currently demonstrating, there is actually several
  seconds of system delay time between the tap on the Museums Button and
  the display of the 2-Museums\_List FRAME. Since we have already
  demonstrated that STEP, we can now go back and insert the system
  delay.
 
  The first system delay is 3.82 seconds (this system delay was actually
  observed in videotapes and log files of the application). Select the
  first occurrence of the delayed screen, i.e., the first line in the
  SCRIPT STEP list where the FRAME is 2-Museum\_List. Figure
  30 shows this line selected, indicated by the blue highlighting.
 
  ![](media/image105.png){width="6.025in" height="3.5360520559930007in"}
 
  Figure 30. The first occurrence of the delayed FRAME is selected.
 
  Then hit the "Wait for System" button below the displayed FRAME. A
  dialog box comes up asking for the duration of the delay. Figure
  31shows 3.82 seconds being entered into this dialog box.

![](media/image107.png){width="5.29in" height="2.98in"}

  Figure 31. The system delay is entered.
 
  After you hit the OK button (or the Enter key), the system delay is
  entered into the SCRIPT STEP List in between the last action on
  the "Start" FRAME and the first action on the "2Museums\_List"
  FRAME, as shown in Figure 32.

![](media/image108.png){width="5.043333333333333in"
height="2.966667760279965in"}

  Figure 32. The result of entering system delay before the
  2-Museums\_List **_FRAME_**.
 
  We can continue with the demonstration by selecting the last line in
  the SCRIPT STEP List.
 
  Enter the next STEP through the contextual menu on the Graffiti¬Æ
  area (enter an "e").
 
  During actual observation after that character was entered, another
  system delay was observed, this time for 3.76 seconds. For our
  demonstration purposes this time, we can enter the system delay in the
  process of demonstrating the TASK. Right after the STEP that
  caused the delay is entered, (entering an "e" in using the Graffiti¬Æ
  area) simply hit the "Wait for System" button and enter the duration
  and CogTool will place the system delay correctly, as shown Figure 33.

![](media/image109.png){width="5.450001093613299in" height="3.16in"}

  Figure 33. The system delay appears in the correct position when
  entered after the step that caused the delay during the
  demonstration
 
  Continue demonstrating the TASK, adding 2.62 seconds of system
  delay before the last screen appears, and the final STEPS SCRIPT
  List is shown in Figure 32.

 3.4 Review and Edit Steps 
-------------------------

  Now that you have demonstrated all the steps that comprise the task of
  "Look-up the Met", spend just a few minutes, to check to make sure the
  actions are in the correct order and that the frames were properly
  linked together.

#### 3.4.1 View Previous STEPS 

  You may view the FRAME being used in a particular SCRIPT STEP
  by clicking on the STEP in the history list.

#### 3.4.2 Recovering from a Mistake when Demonstrating STEPS 

  CogTool 1.0b18 does not allow you to recover from a mistake when you
  are demonstrating STEPS in a TASK. The development team is
  working hard to fix this obvious deficiency in upcoming releases,
  until thenyou must delete each step and start your demonstration over.
  Fortunately, demonstrating STEPS doesn't take very long for most
  TASKS.
 
  KNOWN BUG \#2. The CogTool interface looks like it can change
  STEPS in the middle of a TASK successfully, but it does not
  produce reliable human performance predictions if you do. It does not
  reliably tell you that it is not producing a reliable prediction. This
  is a serious bug and the development team is working on it. To be
  safe, always delete an erroneous SCRIPT completely and
  re-demonstrate the STEPS. Likewise, if you change the design after
  demonstrating a TASK, re-demonstrate the STEPS.

 3.5 Compute Predictions 
-----------------------

  Once you have finished creating the SCRIPT, press the "Close and
  Compute" button to return to the PROJECT window and compute a
  prediction. The result will appear as a value in the table cell for
  the SCRIPT (Figure 35).

![](media/image111.jpg){width="4.223333333333334in"
height="0.6733333333333333in"}

  Figure 35. Predicted task execution time appears in the PROJECT
  window.
 
  That's all there is to it! You can read the value directly out of the
  table cell for the SCRIPT.
 
  NOTE \#5. Do not worry if the predictions in your model are
  slightly different than the ones shown in this tutorial document. The
  predictions depend on the exact size and position of the WIDGETS
  and yours are unlikely to be exactly the same as ours. However, if
  they are off by more than a few tens of milliseconds, you might
  compare your designs to ours to see if there are major differences.
 
  NOTE \#6. If the computation process has an error, it will often
  return either "0.000" or "600.000" as the answer. This is NOT a
  correct prediction! If you get an erroneous result, please check your
  DESIGN and SCRIPT.

4 Extending a DESIGN to Support Multiple TASKS 
==============================================

  Now that we have used CogTool to create a single DESIGN and
  TASK, we can extend our work to support a second TASK. A
  strength of the Keystroke-Level Model type of cognitive performance
  modeling, employed by CogTool, is the ability to compare alternatives.
  To this end, we will use CogTool to predict the time for an alternate
  way to complete the "Lookup the Met" TASK. We will follow the same
  basic steps outlined in Sections 2 and 3 to model the following new
  steps.

1.  Tap the button labeled "Museums" from the first screen.

2.  Tap the on-screen keyboard to enter the characters "m" and "e" to
    filter the museums.

3.  Tap the list item labeled "Metropolitan Museum of Art"

 4.1 Extend the DESIGN 
---------------------

  To perform the new variation of the TASK, you need to add two
  WIDGETS to the DESIGN:

[In FRAME ]{.underline} [Type of WIDGET]{.underline} [Placed
Over]{.underline}

2-Museum\_List Button the on-screen keyboard "M"

3-m\_List Button the on-screen keyboard "E"

  To add new WIDGETS to a DESIGN, open the DESIGN window,
  and then the FRAME windows for the FRAMES you wish to edit.
 
  Similarly, you will need to add two new TRANSITIONS to reflect the
  alternative path through the storyboard:

[In FRAME ]{.underline} [From WIDGET]{.underline} [To
FRAME]{.underline} [Action]{.underline}

2-Museum\_List over "M" 3-m\_List Tap

3-m\_List over "E" 4-me\_List Tap

  When you have finished your modifications, the DESIGN should look
  like Figure 36.
 
  ![](media/image112.jpg){width="3.236666666666667in"
  height="2.8366666666666664in"}
 
  Figure 36. Augmented design that can now support two tasks.
 
  Now, close the DESIGN window to return to the main PROJECT
  window.

 4.2 Add a Second TASK 
---------------------

  Now that the DESIGN has the necessary additions to support the
  second variation of "Lookup the MET", let's add a TASK to the
  PROJECT for that variation. Use the "New Task" command in the
  "Create" menu (Figure 37). Call it "Lookup the MET -- Soft Keyboard."
 
  ![](media/image116.jpg){width="3.3733333333333335in"
  height="1.0266666666666666in"}
 
  Figure 37. "New Task" command in the "Create" menu.
 
  To distinguish the old version of the TASK from the new one,
  double click on the old TASK name and rename it to be "Lookup the
  MET -- Graffiti".
 
  Now, since both these TASKS accomplish the same goal of finding
  the information about the MET, we will put them in a TASK GROUP.
  Select both TASKS and then select the "New Task Group" command
  from the "Create" menu (above). Call the task group "Lookup the MET".
  When this is done, the PROJECT window should look like Figure 38.

![](media/image117.png){width="4.82in" height="0.6666666666666666in"}

  Figure 38. A group of tasks that both accomplish the goal of looking
  up information about the Metropolitan Museum of Art (the MET).
 
  By default, the computation assigned to a group of tasks is the sum of
  all the tasks in the group. This is useful when the tasks in the group
  are subtasks of the task group because their sum would then be the
  total time for the whole task. However, in this case, the two tasks
  are alternative methods for accomplishing the same goal. Therefore, we
  may want to see the mean, minimum or maximum time for accomplishing
  this goal. To change the computation displayed for the TASK
  GROUP to one more meaningful for this tutorial, choose the "Show
  Minimum" option in the "Modify" menu (Figure 39) to get the results in
  Figure 40.

  Figure 40.Calculation changed to showing the minimum time for a TASK
  GROUP.

 4.3 Demonstrate a Second SCRIPT 
-------------------------------

  Finally, to compute the prediction of the second TASK'S
  performance time, we need to demonstrate the steps of the SCRIPT.
  Open the SCRIPT window by double-clicking the table cell at the
  intersection of the "New York Guide" DESIGN and "Lookup the MET--
  Soft Keyboard" TASK. In the FRAME chooser window, select the
  "1-Start" FRAME. Demonstrate the steps of the new TASK by
  clicking on the appropriate WIDGETS, in this sequence:

1.  "1-Start" FRAME: tap the button labeled "Museums"

Insert a system delay of 3.82 seconds

2.  "2-Museums\_List" FRAME: tap the on-screen keyboard character
    "M"

3.  "3-m\_List" FRAME: tap the on-screen keyboard character "E"

Insert a system delay of 3.76 seconds

4.  "4-me\_List" FRAME: tap the list item labeled "Metropolitan
    Museum of Art" Insert a system delay of 2.62 seconds

  When you have completed these SCRIPT STEPS, press the "Close and
  Compute" button on the SCRIPT window to close the window and
  compute the prediction. When you have done this, the PROJECT
  window should look like Figure 41.

![](media/image120.jpg){width="5.036666666666667in" height="1.08in"}

  Figure 41. The PROJECT window is populated with the desired
  predictions.
 
  As you can see, the Soft Keyboard method is about 0.1 seconds slower
  than the Graffiti¬Æ method, a mere 0.7% of the total time. However, the
  magnitude of the total time is heavily influenced by the more than 10
  seconds of system delay observed in the application. If you want to
  see how much time is contributed just by using the soft keyboard,
  behavior that might be obtainable if the application were made much
  faster, edit the scripts by deleting the wait-for-system steps and
  re-compute -- its just that easy!
 
  NOTE \#7. Again, do not worry if the predictions in your model are
  slightly different than the ones shown in this tutorial document. The
  predictions depend on the exact size and position of the WIDGETS
  and yours are unlikely to be exactly the same as ours. However, if
  they are off by more than a few tens of milliseconds, you might
  compare your designs to ours to see if there are major differences.

5 Conclusion 
============

  You can continue adding new DESIGNS and new TASKS as much as
  you would like to explore options with your DESIGN. You can group
  tasks either as alternatives (as we did in the tutorial example) or as
  subtasks that add up to a whole task denoted by A TASK GROUP.
  Breaking a whole task into subtasks lets you explore alternatives for
  parts of a task instead of having to demonstrate the entire task each
  time (which can get tedious for longer tasks).
 
  PS. Don't forget to look at the "Two More Fun Things" on the next few
  pages.

6 Two More Fun Things 
=====================

 6.1 Capturing Backgrounds to Move Widgets 
-----------------------------------------

  Our tutorial example did not provide the opportunity to show a neat
  feature of CogTool, the ability to capture the look of a WIDGET
  and move it around to find a better arrangement of WIDGETS.
 
  Look back at
 
  ![](media/image121.jpg){width="2.0in" height="0.95in"}Figure 16, where
  the "Museums" button was created on the "1-Start" FRAME. The
  Capture Background button on the bottom right of the window captures
  the bit-map within the orange WIDGET bounding box. In this case,
  it would be the rounded rectangle button labeled "Museums". This
  button can now be moved around to anywhere in the Frame and it retains
  the look of the "Museums" button. In Figure 42, we have put the
  Museums button in the middle of the Graffiti¬Æ area -- a silly thing to
  do, but easy to see how the feature works.
 
  This feature can be used to create totally new layouts from one
  screenshot of all the
 
  WIDGETS in a FRAME. Simply create a FRAME with all the
  desired WIDGETS and capture the background for each one. Copy each
  WIDGET and paste it onto a FRAME with a blank or neutral
  background and move the WIDGETS wherever you want them to be.
 
  ![](media/image122.jpg){width="1.7633333333333334in"
  height="2.5166666666666666in"}
 
  Figure 42. The background of the "Museums" button WIDGET has been
  captured and the WIDGET has been moved to the center of the Graffiti¬Æ
  area.

 6.2 Understanding the Predictions 
---------------------------------

  The underlying computation cognitive engine that makes the predictions
  is called ACT-R and is very complex. To learn more about it, you can
  go to the ACT-R website. [http://act-r.psy.cmu.edu/]{.underline}
 
  We have built a visualization tool into CogTool so you can see what
  ACT-R is doing to produce the predictions. Although this visualization
  is meant for cognitive psychology researcher to validate CogTool's and
  ACT-R's predictions, it is fun and may entice you to learn more about
  computational cognitive modeling.
 
  To see the visualization, in the PROJECT window use the contextual
  menu on a SCRIPT cell to select "Show Model Visualization" (Figure
  43). You can open as many visualization windows as you wish, and align
  them to compare the execution traces and see where their times differ.

![](media/image123.jpg){width="3.953333333333333in"
height="2.0033333333333334in"}

  Figure 43. The Contextual menu on a SCRIPT cell for the TASK "Lookup
  the MET -- Graffiti".
 
  To see what ACT-R is doing, select the "Model Trace" tab located at
  the top of the right pane of the window.

height="1.2166666666666666in"}

  Figure 44. Tabs in the right pane of a visualization window.
 
  Once both Visualization windows are open, place one above the other
  and resize them so you can see both windows (see Figure 45).

![](media/image135.jpg){width="5.996666666666667in"
height="3.8533333333333335in"}

  Figure 45. Comparison of Graffiti to Soft-keyboard methods in ACT-R
  visualization windows
 
  In the left pane is a timeline showing the different activities ACT-R
  goes through to make the predictions. The right pane shows a textual
  trace of these same activities.
 
  In the left pane, time runs from left to right and the width of the
  boxes are proportional to the time they take to execute. The rows of
  boxes are different types of "operators" that happen in the course of
  performing these tasks.
 
  The top row is labeled "Frame" and shows the duration that each frame
  is visible as the task is performed.
 
  KNOWN BUG \#3. The frames are not actually visible as long as
  these boxes indicate. When there is a system wait, one frame
  disappears and the next one doesn't show up for the duration of the
  system wait. This is not shown correctly in the current visualization.
  For example, frame 2-Museum\_List is shown as visible at about 1.6 s
  into the task. It is really not visible until about 5.7 s into the
  task. A person well-versed in ACT-R would be able to see this
  discrepancy in the visualization because the vision row and the
  production row have many short pairs of operators between 1.6 s and
  5.7 s. This pattern of operators represents the eyes trying to see the
  next button, but the frame not being visible, so the vision system
  returns a "failure" signal to cognition. As soon as the frame is
  visible, the vision operator is much longer, as it actually find the
  next button to press and returns its location to cognition.
 
  The next row (purple) is Vision, which represents the eyes seeing
  objects on the frame.
 
  The next row (grey) is labeled "Productions" (the elements of a
  production system, which is the type of cognitive engine that ACT-R
  employs), which represent the thoughts the model has when performing
  this task. The long boxes in this row are the Think operators. Short
  boxes are other types of cognitive operators that initiate motor
  movements motor and visual attention shifts.
 
  The next three rows (shades of red) represent different aspects of the
  motor system employed by ACT-R. ACT-R‚Äôs motor system is complex and
  beyond the scope of this tutorial, but the bottom row (darkest red)
  shows the motor movement that would be observable on a video:
  horizontal movements of a finger, stylus, or mouse, clicks of a mouse
  button or key presses. In these models, only horizontal movements of
  the stylus is shown, because it uses a Palm device that uses a stylus
  (not a mouse or keyboard).
 
  If you click on a box in the left pane, it highlights the part of the
  model trace that corresponds to it in the right pane.
 
  The biggest difference between the two models evident in the timelines
  is that the Graffiti¬Æ model has long red motor operators where the
  Graffiti¬Æ gestures are (around 6.4 s and 7.2 s) and the Soft-keyboard
  model has much shorter motor movements to poke the M-key and the
  E-key. This is because Graffiti¬Æ gestures take about 0.5 seconds to
  complete, on average and the soft-key poking time is calculated from
  Fitts‚Äôs law. Offsetting this savings in motor time, the Soft-keyboard
  model has an additional Think operator between the M-key and the E-key
  that the Graffiti¬Æ model does not have between the m-gesture and the
  e-gesture. By default, ‚Äúme‚Äù is treated as a ‚Äúcognitive unit‚Äù by
  CogTool when entered as successive Graffiti¬Æ gestures that are not
  commands, and successive soft-keyboard presses are not because each
  key is modeled as a button. We are currently collecting data to
  validate these approximations. If you would like to see what the times
  would be if the Think operator was not inserted between the M-key and
  the E-key, simply delete it from the script and close and compute.
  (Deleting and inserting Think steps and System Wait steps are the only
  safe modifications you can make to scripts without re-demonstrating.)
 
  Have fun with this visualization.
