## Chapter 2: Getting started with CogTool

### Downloading CogTool

The latest public release of CogTool is available from the CogTool
Project's website on the download page
(http://cogtool.hcii.cs.cmu.edu/use-today/download-cogtool).

CogTool is available for Windows XP/Vista and Mac OS X versions 10.4.8
and later.

### 2.2 Installing CogTool

#### 2.2.1 Installing on Mac OS X

-   When you download the CogTool file from the website, your browser
    will launch archive software, such as Stuffit, to unpack the CogTool
    executable. If it does not, double-click the downloaded CogTool file
    to expand it.<br>
    
    <ul><li class="icon fyi">The CogTool file is expanded in the same location as the down loaded file, which in most cases is the Desktop.</li></ul>

-   Place the expanded CogTool application file whatever you like.
    Although many people prefer to put it in the **Applications**
    folder, CogTool will run from any location on your hard drive or
    writable external storage media.

#### 2.2.2 Installing on Windows XP and Vista

-   You must have the Java Runtime Environment (JRE 1.5 or later)
    installed in order to use CogTool. If you do not know if you have
    JRE installed, you can test it by opening this link in your web
    browser: [[http://www.java.com/en/download/
    help/testvm.xml]](http://www.java.com/en/download/help/testvm.xml).
    This page will automatically test your computer and tell you whether
    JRE is installed or not. If you do not already have JRE installed,
    the latest release and instructions on how to install it are
    available at [[http://www.java.
    com/en/download/]](http://java.com/en/download/).

-   Double-click the CogTool installer to launch the install wizard.

-   Follow the instructions in the wizard to complete the CogTool
    installation. You can install CogTool where ever you wish on you
    hard drive.

-   Once CogTool is installed, it can be launched from the Windows Start
    Menu, or double-clicked where ever its icon appears.

### 2.3 Launching CogTool

You can launch CogTool by double-clicking the application icon or by
choosing the application from the listing in the Windows Start Menu.

<ul><li class="icon bug">Double-clicking on a saved project file (.cgt file) to open it is notrecommended. In Mac OS X, it does nothing, in Windows it
opens a new instance of CogTool even if one is already running.
Instead, first launch CogTool. then click the **Open** button and
navigate to the saved CogTool file. If you have been working with the
project recently, it will show up in the **Open Recent** pulldown
list.</li></ul>
<ul><li class="icon remember">
With Mac OS X, you can launch the CogTool application from any location to which you save it.</li></ul>

### 2.4 Exploring CogTool

Although CogTool is not intended to be a walk-up-and-use system,
especially if you want to get cognitively plausible quantitative
predictions of skilled performance time, CogTool's user interface
provides common facilities to aid exploration.

-   *Menus*. Almost all commands are accessible through the menus at the
    top of the window (Windows) or screen (Mac). Menus are tailored to
    the currently active window, so explore them all. If there are
    keyboard shortcuts for the command, they are listed in the menus.

-   *Context Menus*. The most common commands used in a window or on an
    object are available in a context menu invoked by right-clicking
    (Windows) or CTRLclicking (Mac). They are listed in Appendix G.

-   *Roll-overs*. You can roll over many objects in CogTool to get more
    information about them. For example, roll-over the tools in the
    Widget or Transition to see their names. Roll-over a Transition in
    the Design window to see its type, source and target. Roll-over a
    Widget anywhere to see its display label, name and type.

-   *Double-clicking*. Double-clicking something tends to open it for
    editing. In the Project windows, double-clicking on a Design name
    opens a window to edit that Design; double-clicking a cell opens its
    Script window. In a Design window, double-clicking a Frame opens a
    window for editing that Frame. In a Script window, double-clicking
    the Frame name opens the Frame editor; double-clicking a Think
    operator allows you to edit its label and duration. You get the
    idea - if you want to edit something, try double-clicking it.

*and most important,*

-   *Undo*. Works. Multi-level. Fear not \-- you can undo anything
    you've done, so explore with impunity.

### 2.5 CogTool Help

We do not currently have on-line help for CogTool;. However, user
forums are available at {{ site.weburl }}/ where you can get
questions answered and see what other people do.
We encourage you to have this pdf document open in Adobe Reader as you
work in CogTool. Be sure to use the Bookmarks feature of Reader, so
you can navigate easily around the User Guide. We have enabled
commenting, so you can mark up the document as you like.

If you are running Mac OSX 10.5 or later, we encourage you to explore
the automatic help for menu items. Consider the case where you are
trying to align several widgets (highlighted in purple) but you have
forgotten where the alignment commands are in the menus. If you open
the Help menu in MacOSX and search for "align", it lists all the menu
items that contain "align" and if you roll over one of them, it opens
the correct menu and points to the command (pointer in dark blue).

Apple's Mac OSX 10.5 or later. Menus change depending on which type of window is
active, so explore different windows when looking for a particular
command.
